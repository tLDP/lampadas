NOTE: Installation is being reworked, but this is how it works now:

Installation from the tarball or .tar.gz, or from CVS, uses standard
Makefiles. run `make` to build the few things that need to be built,
primarily the documentation. Then run `make install` as root to install
files.

Files are installed into the following locations by default. To change
them, edit the Makefiles.

binaries:	/usr/local/bin
man pages:	/usr/share/man/man5
		/usr/share/man/man8
Lampadas.pth:	/usr/local/lib/site-python
python modules:	/usr/local/lib/site-python/Lampadas
html, png, css:	/usr/local/share/lampadas/www
SQL scripts:	/usr/local/share/lampadas/sql

If you want to use other directories, edit the Makefiles before
running install.

Installation Notes on Mandrake 8.2

    If you have chosen database packages during installation, this is installed.
    Still have to use chkconfig to start the postgresql server automatically

    Download libxslt1-devel
        wget ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.net/linux/Mandrake/8.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/libxslt1-devel-1.0.12-1mdk.i586.rpm
    Install it
        rpm -i libxslt1-devel-1.0.12-1mdk.i586.rpm
    Download libxslt-proc

wt2db, texi2db
    Check http://www.tldp.org/downloads/ for the current versions.
    For both the packages unpack, move to the proper directory and
    Generate Makefile               
        perl ./Makefile.PL 
    Build the package: 
        make 
    Install the files in the appropriate locations: 
        make install
jade or openjade for LinuxDoc conversions
    Already installed
xmllint for SGML to XML conversions and validation
    Already installed
docbook-to-man for manpage generation
    Get docbook-to-man
        wget http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/tools/dtm/docbook-to-man.tar.gz
    Uncompress it
        tar zxvf docbook-to-man.tar.gz
    It doesn't compile by default.
        Remove lines 708, 807 in file Instant/tptregexp/regexp.c
    Make and install it
        make
        su
        make install
    Change the dtd and dcl settings in /usr/local/bin/docbook-to-man script
    as 
        ROOT=/usr
        SGMLS=$ROOT/share/sgml
        DOCBOOK=$SGMLS/docbook/sgml-dtd-3.1
        ..
        ..
        CATALOG=$DOCBOOK/catalog
        DECL=$DOCBOOK/docbook.dcl

    Get from docbook sourceforge site.
        wget http://telia.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.51.1.tar.gz
    Uncompress and move to a proper location like /usr/share/sgml
        tar zxvf docbook-xsl-1.5.1.1.tar.gz
        su
        mv docbook-xsl-1.5.1.1.tar.gz /usr/share/sgml/docbook
        ln -s /usr/share/sgml/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.5.1.1.tar.gz

    Change the xsl:import statement in the xsl stylesheets in xsl directory
docbook dsssl stylesheets
    Already installed
linuxdoc dtds
linuxdoc dsssl stylesheets
    I am not sure whether this is needed or not. I downloaded the noarch
    rpm and put it in /usr/share/sgml
        wget ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.net/linux/yellowdog/old_releases/champion-1.2/ppc/YellowDog/RPMS/linuxdoc-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
