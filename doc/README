DEBIAN

    Manual pages are generated from the corresponding sgml-sources by
    calling docbook-to-man:

        docbook-to-man manpage.sgml > manpage.1

    The docbook-to-man binary is found in the docbook-to-man package.
    Please remember that if you create the nroff version in one of the
    debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need to include
    docbook-to-man in your Build-Depends control field.

REDHAT

    Use docbook2man to generate the manual pages.
    The file name is determined from entities: <refentrytitle>.<manvolnum>

        docbook2man manpage.sgml

VIEW RESULTS

    You can view manual pages with:

        nroff -man manpage.1 | less
