0.9.4	2002-09-17	Partially implemented DataCollection and DataObject base classes,
			which encapsulate all of the common functionality, including data
			caching, filtering, and database synchronization.

0.9.5	2002-09-08	More work on the data objects.

0.9.6	2002-10-11	Created two new packages -- persistence and
			datamanager. datamanager does all the talking to the
			database, and persistence is a class for persistent
			objects. datamanager works like an object factory,
			accepting requests for object sets and serving them.

			Implemented a cache for each datamanager.

			Finally fixed database synchronization issues. I hope.
