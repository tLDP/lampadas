<section id="intro"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
This mini-HOWTO was created by gathering the information already available on
the internet, in newsgroups and other HOWTOs. I needed to hook up an USB mouse
in addition to the built-in trackpoint on my Thinkpad laptop. 
</para>
<para>
Examples in this mini-HOWTO pertain to my particular hardware configuration,
which is PS/2 mouse as a primary pointer and USB wheel mouse as an additional
one. It should be pretty straightforward to implement another combination, say,
a PS/2 and a serial mice. Two things that would have to be changed are the
<emphasis>mouse
protocol</emphasis> and the <emphasis>mouse device</emphasis>. Wherever
possible, I try to provide appropriate examle. 
</para>
<para>
The instructions for X are divided into two sections, one fro XFree version 3 and one
for XFree 4. The format of the XF86Config file has significantly changed between
versions and requires slightly different approach. In XFree 3.x, the second
mouse has to appear in an <emphasis>Xinput</emphasis> section, which has
slightly different syntax than the regular <emphasis>Pointer</emphasis> section.
In XFree 4.x, it's just another pointer.
</para>

<section id="protocol"><title>Mouse Protocols</title>
<para>Two most important parameters in the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file, ones that are crucial to the mouse working properly are the <emphasis>Protocol</emphasis> and <emphasis>Device</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
As far as <emphasis>Protocol</emphasis> is concerned, it seems that
<emphasis>gpm</emphasis> uses compatible protocol names, so please look there
for the detailed information. Here is the excerpt taken from the gpm info page
(just the few most commont types):

<section id="xfree3"><title>XFree 3.x</title>
<para>
In XFree 3.x, additional pointing devices, like mice or tablets, are defined
through the use of an <emphasis>Xinput</emphasis> section. The primary mouse is
defined as usual:
<programlisting>
Section "Pointer"
    Protocol    "PS/2"
    Device      "/dev/mouse"
EndSection
</programlisting>
In the case above, it's a regular three-button PS/2 mouse, which works for the
trackpoint as well. Now, for the USB mouse:
<programlisting>
    Section "Xinput"
  SubSection "Mouse"
    DeviceName "USB Mice"
    Protocol "IMPS/2"
    ZAxisMapping 4 5
    Port "/dev/input/mice"
    Alwayscore
  EndSubSection
EndSection
</programlisting>
My mouse is a wheel mouse, thus the protocol is <emphasis>IMPS/2</emphasis>. ZAxisMapping line is also needed for the wheel to work.
I also want the mouse to always work alongside the other one, and this is achieved
through the <emphasis>AlwaysCore</emphasis> option. If. for example, this was 
a serial mouse, the <emphasis>Port</emphasis> would read 
<command>"/dev/ttyS0"</command> for <command>COM1</command>. 
</para>

</section>

<section id="xfree4"><title>XFree 4.x</title>
<para>
With XFree 4.x the task is even easier. First, the primary mouse, usually present in the config file already:
<programlisting>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "PS/2"
        Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "off"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection
</programlisting>
To add another mouse just copy the above section and modify it, so that it reads:
<programlisting>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse1"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
        Option      "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
        Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "off"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection
</programlisting>
Well, this way you can define as many additional pointers as you wish, and the same applies to joysticks and tablets.
</para>
<para>
To make both mice work together, there's one more change to be made to the <filename>XF86Config</filename> file.
There is a section called <emphasis>ServerLayout</emphasis> where all the components are specified. Here's how it looks <emphasis>before</emphasis> adding a second mouse:
<programlisting>
Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "XFree86 Configured"
        Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
        InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
        InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection
</programlisting>
And <emphasis>after</emphasis> adding the second mouse:
<programlisting>
Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "XFree86 Configured"
        Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
        InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
        InputDevice    "Mouse1" "AlwaysCore"
        InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection
</programlisting>
</para>
</section>

<section id="alternatives"><title>Alternatives</title>
<para>
Another way to use two (or more) mice at the same time time is to use a program such as <emphasis>MultiMouse</emphasis> by Takashi Manabe. It's a daemon multiplexing several mice and making them available through the special device <filename>/dev/mumse</filename> as a MouseSystems compatible mouse.
</para><para> According to the author: <quote>This program allows you to use multiple mice at the same time. This program is developed for a subnote user who want to use both a pre-mounted pointing device and a external serial mouse.</quote></para><para>I'm not sure if the program supports second mouse other than serial, but the advantage is that the second mouse works in console mode too. <command>MultiMouse</command> can be found at Sunsite (sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/system/Misc) and Tucows (www.tucows.com Linux Console -> Utilities).
