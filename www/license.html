<p>There have been several version of the LDP License.
When populating the license field for documents which are licensed under one of these, 
please make sure you select the correct one.

<p><dt>LDPL (FREE)</dt>
<dd>
<b>LDPL</b> means "Linux Documentation Project License".

<p>It has this in its heading and also has "(LDPL)" in its
heading.  It's found at:
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/COPYRIGHT.html</a>.
</dd>

<p><dt>LDPCL (Non-Free)</dt>
<dd>
<b>LDPCL</b> means "LDP Copying License".

<p>The older "Linux Documentation Project Copying License" is
found at:
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP-COPYRIGHT.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP-COPYRIGHT.html</a>.

<p>Several documents have copied it into their HOWTOs, although few point to it.
Unfortunately, this non-free
license was left in the Manifesto until David Lawyer removed it (in 1999 with the
consensus of LDP).  It remained in the Manifesto long after it became
obsolete.  It appears in a Manifesto dated 1993, only a year after the
founding of the LDP.  It was likely the first license used by LDP.  The
1998 revision of the Manifesto failed to remove it.
</dd>

<p><dt>HOWTOL (FREE, but probably by mistake)</dt>
<dd>
<b>HOWTOL</b> is the
license used for the HOWTO-INDEX. It is found at
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/copyright.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/copyright.html</a>.

<p>It had a statement in it
that the HOWTO-coordinator could make
exceptions regarding the license needed by derived works.  I think that
this statement was only supposed to be valid for the HOWTO-INDEX of
which the HOWTO-coordinator was the author.  But unfortunately, others
decided to use this license for their own howtos and they retained the
wording without changing "HOWTO coordinator" to their own name.  The
HOWTO-INDEX is insidious in this respect since the license reads like it
was intended for all HOWTOs and there was no statement in the
HOWTO-INDEX that one should or shouldn't use that license (or at least
that if you did use it, that you should substitute your own name for
"HOWTO coordinator").
</dd>

<p><dt>BOILERPLATE (Non-Free)</dt>
<dd>
Another license which is just presented as a possible license to use and
is not really a LDP license, is the one in the Manifesto
("<b>Boilerplate</b>").  It originally was about the same (maybe exactly the
same) as the non-free "Copying License".  Then it was changed to be free
in late 1999.

<p>It can be found at
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html#s5">http://www.linuxdoc.org/manifesto.html#s5</a>.
