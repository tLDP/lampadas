insert([lampadas], [About Lampadas],
[
    <p>Lampadas is an interactive environment for writing, managing, publishing and reading documentation.

    <p>As a Lampadas member, you are part of a collaborative community which includes authors, editors, technical experts, and readers all working together to document the Linux system, and to share information with each other.

    <p>See <a href="contribute">Contributing to Lampadas</a>.

    <h2>Why Lampadas?</h2>

    <p>Fans of Frank Herbert\'s Dune series will recognize Lampadas as the name of the Bene Gesserit teaching planet, which plays a role in the final book, Chapterhouse: Dune. Before the planet can be destroyed by hordes of Honored Matres, Reverend Mother Lucia orders the planet to share Other Memory, two by two then four by four, until all the students hold within them the composite knowledge and memories of the entire planet. After the planet is annihilated by the Honored Matres, the precious knowledge is carried back to the Bene Gesserit Chapterhouse by the lone holder of the precious cargo, Rebecca.

    <p>Herbert apparently took the name from the city of Lampadas, which was an ancient seat of learning and scholarship. Also, the word lampadas is the accusative form of the word "Torch" in ancient Greek.

    <p>In all of these senses, Lampadas seems an appropriate name for this project, which is created to facilitate sharing information from many people and many sources, and disseminating it widely to others.

    As a member of this Lampadas System, you benefit from the work of hundreds of Linux users who have given freely of their time and knowledge to create the enormous LDP document collection. We\'re sure that you would like to give a little back in return, and help make us even better.
    We\'ve designed the Lampadas system to make giving back simple and easy. Here are some ways you can help, roughly in order of difficulty or commitment required:

    <ul>
    <li>Rate Documents

    <p>Each document has a "rating", on a scale of 1 to 10, which tells you what other readers think of it. We use this rating to improve our documents, for focusing our attention on the documents you\'ve identified as neednig improvement.</li>

    <li>Report a Bug

    <p>If you find an error in any document, file a bug report.
    </li>
    <li>Translate a Document

    <p>Translators are always in short supply, and we value them very much. Our goal is to provide all of our documentation in as many languages as possible, allowing people all over the world to take advantage of it.
    </li>

    <li>Translate Lampadas

    <p>The Lampadas System itself can be localized to display in several languages. Translators are needed to translate it into additional languages. It is currently available in:

    <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Write a Document

    <p>If you are a good writer with solid technical knowledge, write a new document and contribute it to the collection. Lampadas has several tools that will help you.</li>
    </ul>
