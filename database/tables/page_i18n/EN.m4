    <p>Welcome to |strproject|.</p>

    <p>This site is based on a development version of the
    Lampadas Document Management System from
    <a href="http://www.tldp.org">The Linux Documentation Project</a></p>

    <p>This is <i><b>alpha quality</b></i> code, updated from the cvs tree
    very frequently, whenever there are significant features or
    bugfixes available.
    This happens at least once a day and sometimes
    several times a day.
    The system is fairly stable, although some half-
    implemented features will cause ugly error dumps.</p>
    
    <p>This demo site is populated with data from the LDPDB.
    If you had an account on the LDPDB, you have one here.
    However, because passwords on the LDPDB are stored only in
    hashed form, I was unable to port them over, and you\'ve been
    given a new password. To get it, click the "Mail Password"
    link and your new password will be mailed to your address
    of record.</p>

    <p>There are also a set of additional test users.
    Log in as one of them to see the site through their eyes.
    The pages change depending on your access level.
    These users\'passwords are "password".</p>

    <ul>
        <li>sysadmin - the SUPERUSER, who manages the system.</li>
        <li>admin - the Site Administrator, who manages the content.</li>
        <li>french - a French-speaking user.</li>
        <li>german - a German-speaking user.</li>
        <li>korean - a Korean-speaking user.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We greatly appreciate your comments, bug reports or questions.

    <p>As a member of this Lampadas community, you can collaborate with
    hundreds or even thousands of others to produce documentation,
    which can then be shared with others all around the world over the
    Web.
    
    <p>We\'ve designed the Lampadas system to make contributing simple and easy.
    Here are some ways you can help, roughly in order of difficulty or
    commitment required:

    <ul>
    <li>Rate Documents

    <p>Each document has a "rating", on a scale of 1 to 10, which tells you
    what other readers think of it.
    We use this rating to improve our documents, for focusing our attention
    on the documents you\'ve identified as neednig improvement.
    </li>

    <li>Report a Bug

    <p>If you find an error in any document, file a bug report.
    </li>
    
    <li>Translate a Document

    <p>Translators are always in short supply, and we value them very much.
    Our goal is to provide all of our documentation in as many languages
    as possible, allowing people all over the world to take advantage of it.
    </li>

    <li>Write a Document

    <p>If you are a good writer with solid technical knowledge,
    write a new document and contribute it to the collection.
    Lampadas has several tools that will help you.
    </li>
    
    <li>Help Lampadas

    <p>If you have programming or translating skills, you can help to develop
    the platform upon which this site is based.

    <p>The Lampadas System itself can be localized to display in several
    languages. Translators are needed to translate it into additional
    languages.

insert([unmaintained], [Unmaintained Documents], [],

    <p>If you wish to become the maintainer for one of these unmaintained
    documents, please follow these steps:

    <ul>
        <li>Contact the original author. If not listed, consult the document.
        Make sure the author no longer wishes to maintain the document in question.

        <li>Determine if a more up-to-date copy of the document exists, outside
        of what is available here. The best way to do this is through the
        former maintainer. If you can, secure a copy of the most recent
        version and submit it here.

        <li>Inform the site administrator that you would like to maintain the
        document. The administrator will assign you the necessary rights so
        you can begin maintaining it.

        <li>Update the document, adding yourself as the current maintainer.
        Be sure that you continue to credit all former maintainers.
    </ul>

    <p>It is possible that a document could be listed here erroneously.
    If you find an error, please notify the site administrator right away
    so we can correct the problem.

insert([lampadas], [About Lampadas], [],
[
    <p>This website is based on version |version| of the Lampadas
    Documentation Management System,
    a Free Software (GPL) platform developed by
    <a href="http://www.tldp.org">The Linux Documentation Project</a>.
    
    <p>Lampadas is a powerful, flexible platform designed to support
    large documentation projects such as the LDP.
    It provides an interactive environment for writing, managing,
    publishing and reading documentation.

    <p>Lampadas creates a collaborative community which
    includes authors, editors, technical experts, and readers all working
    together to produce documentation, and to share information with
    each other.

    <h1>Why Lampadas?</h1>

    <p>Fans of Frank Herbert\'s Dune series will recognize Lampadas
    as the name of the Bene Gesserit teaching planet, which plays a
    role in the final book,
    Chapterhouse: Dune.
    Before the planet can be destroyed by hordes of Honored Matres,
    Reverend Mother Lucilla orders the planet to share Other Memory,
    two by two then four by four, until all the students hold within
    them the composite knowledge and memories of the entire planet.
    After the planet is annihilated by the Honored Matres, the precious
    knowledge is carried back to the Bene Gesserit Chapterhouse by the
    lone holder of the precious cargo, Rebecca.

    <p>Herbert apparently took the name from the city of Lampadas,
    which was an ancient seat of learning and scholarship.
    Also, the word lampadas is the accusative form of the word
    "Torch" in ancient Greek.

    <p>In all of these senses, Lampadas seems an appropriate name for
    this project, which is created to facilitate sharing information
    from many people and many sources, and disseminating it widely to others.
