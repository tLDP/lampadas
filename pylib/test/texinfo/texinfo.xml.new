These programs are <emphasis role='bold'>free</emphasis>; this means that everyone is free to use
them and free to redistribute them on a free basis.  The Texinfo-related
programs are not in the public domain; they are copyrighted and there
are restrictions on their distribution, but these restrictions are
designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want
to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further
sharing any version of these programs that they might get from you.
</para>
<para>Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of the programs that relate to Texinfo, that you receive source
code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.
</para>
<para>To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the Texinfo related programs, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
</para>
<para>Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to Texinfo.
If these programs are modified by someone else and passed on, we want
their recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.

<indexterm><primary>Introduction to Texinfo</primary></indexterm>

<para>Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document with the normal
features of a book, including chapters, sections, cross references, and
indices.  From the same Texinfo source file, you can create a
menu-driven, online Info file with nodes, menus, cross references, and
indices.  You can also create from that same source file an HTML output
file suitable for use with a web browser, or an XML file.  <citetitle>The GNU Emacs Manual</citetitle> is a good example of a Texinfo file, as is this manual.
</para>
<para>To make a printed document, you process a Texinfo source file with the
TeX typesetting program (but the Texinfo language is very different
from TeX's usual language, plain TeX).  This creates a DVI file
that you can typeset and print as a book or report (see <link linkend='hardcopy'>Hardcopy</link>).
</para>
<para>To output an Info file, process your Texinfo source with the
<literal>makeinfo</literal> utility or Emacs's <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> command.
You can install the result in your Info tree (see <link linkend='installing-an-info-file'>Installing an Info File</link>).
</para>
<para>To output an HTML file, run <literal>makeinfo --html</literal> on your Texinfo
source.  You can (for example) install the result on your web site.

<indexterm><primary>SGML-tools output format</primary></indexterm>
<para>If you are a programmer and would like to contribute to the GNU project
by implementing additional output formats for Texinfo, that would be
excellent.  But please do not write a separate translator texi2foo for
your favorite format foo!  That is the hard way to do the job, and makes
extra work in subsequent maintenance, since the Texinfo language is
continually being enhanced and updated.  Instead, the best approach is
modify <literal>makeinfo</literal> to generate the new format, as it does now for
Info and HTML.
</para>
<para>TeX works with virtually all printers; Info works with virtually all
computer terminals; the HTML output works with virtually all web
browsers.  Thus Texinfo can be used by almost any computer user.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Source file</primary></indexterm>
<para>A Texinfo source file is a plain ascii file containing text and
<emphasis role='bold'>@-commands</emphasis> (words preceded by an <literal>@</literal>) that tell the
typesetting and formatting programs what to do.  You may edit a Texinfo
file with any text editor; but it is especially convenient to use GNU
Emacs since that editor has a special mode, called Texinfo mode, that
provides various Texinfo-related features.  (See <link linkend='texinfo-mode'>Texinfo Mode</link>.)
</para>
<para>Before writing a Texinfo source file, you should learn about nodes,
menus, cross references, and the rest, for example by reading this
manual.
</para>
<para>You can use Texinfo to create both online help and printed manuals;
moreover, Texinfo is freely redistributable.  For these reasons, Texinfo
is the official documentation format of the GNU project.  More
information is available at the <ulink url='http://www.gnu.org/doc/'>GNU documentation web page</ulink>.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Man page output, not supported</primary></indexterm>
<para>From time to time, proposals are made to generate traditional Unix man
pages from Texinfo source.  This is not likely to ever be supported,
because man pages have a very strict conventional format.  Merely
enhancing <command>makeinfo</command> to output troff format would be
insufficient.  Generating a good man page therefore requires a
completely different source than the typical Texinfo applications of
generating a good user manual or a good reference manual.  This makes
generating man pages incompatible with the Texinfo design goal of not
having to document the same information in different ways for different
output formats.  You might as well just write the man page directly.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>O'Dea, Brendan</primary></indexterm>
<para>If you wish to support man pages, the program <command>help2man</command> may be
useful; it generates a traditional man page from the <literal>--help</literal>
output of a program.  In fact, this is currently used to generate man
pages for the Texinfo programs themselves.  It is GNU software written
by Brendan O'Dea, available from

</sect2>

<sect2 id='info-files'><title id='info-files-title'>Info files</title>
<indexterm><primary>Info files</primary></indexterm>

<para>An Info file is a Texinfo file formatted so that the Info documentation
reading program can operate on it.  (<literal>makeinfo</literal>
and <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> are two commands that convert a Texinfo file
into an Info file.)
</para>
<para>Info files are divided into pieces called <emphasis role='bold'>nodes</emphasis>, each of which
contains the discussion of one topic.  Each node has a name, and
contains both text for the user to read and pointers to other nodes,
which are identified by their names.  The Info program displays one node
at a time, and provides commands with which the user can move to other
related nodes.
</para>

<para>Each node of an Info file may have any number of child nodes that
describe subtopics of the node's topic.  The names of child
nodes are listed in a <emphasis role='bold'>menu</emphasis> within the parent node; this
allows you to use certain Info commands to move to one of the child
nodes.  Generally, an Info file is organized like a book.  If a node
is at the logical level of a chapter, its child nodes are at the level
of sections; likewise, the child nodes of sections are at the level
of subsections.
</para>
<para>All the children of any one parent are linked together in a
bidirectional chain of `Next' and `Previous' pointers.  The `Next'
pointer provides a link to the next section, and the `Previous' pointer
provides a link to the previous section.  This means that all the nodes
that are at the level of sections within a chapter are linked together.
Normally the order in this chain is the same as the order of the
children in the parent's menu.  Each child node records the parent node
name as its `Up' pointer.  The last child has no `Next' pointer, and the
first child has the parent both as its `Previous' and as its `Up'
pointer.<footnote><para>In some documents, the first child has no `Previous' pointer.  Occasionally, the last child has the node name of the next following higher level node as its `Next' pointer.</para></footnote>
</para>
<para>The book-like structuring of an Info file into nodes that correspond
to chapters, sections, and the like is a matter of convention, not a
requirement.  The `Up', `Previous', and `Next' pointers of a node can
point to any other nodes, and a menu can contain any other nodes.
Thus, the node structure can be any directed graph.  But it is usually
more comprehensible to follow a structure that corresponds to the
structure of chapters and sections in a printed book or report.
</para>
<para>In addition to menus and to `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers, Info
provides pointers of another kind, called references, that can be
sprinkled throughout the text.  This is usually the best way to
represent links that do not fit a hierarchical structure.
</para>
<para>Usually, you will design a document so that its nodes match the
structure of chapters and sections in the printed output.  But
occasionally there are times when this is not right for the material
being discussed.  Therefore, Texinfo uses separate commands to specify
the node structure for the Info file and the section structure for the
printed output.
</para>
<para>Generally, you enter an Info file through a node that by convention is
named `Top'.  This node normally contains just a brief summary of the
file's purpose, and a large menu through which the rest of the file is
reached.  From this node, you can either traverse the file
systematically by going from node to node, or you can go to a specific
node listed in the main menu, or you can search the index menus and then
go directly to the node that has the information you want.  Alternatively,
with the standalone Info program, you can specify specific menu items on
the command line (see (info)).
</para>
<para>If you want to read through an Info file in sequence, as if it were a
printed manual, you can hit <keycap>SPC</keycap> repeatedly, or you get the whole
file with the advanced Info command <keycap>g</keycap><keycap>*</keycap>.  (See (info)Advanced Info commands.)
</para>
<!--  !!! dir file may be located in one of many places: -->

<!--      /usr/local/emacs/info            mentioned in info.c DEFAULT_INFOPATH -->

<!--      /usr/local/info -->

<!--      /usr/local/lib/info -->

<para>The <filename>dir</filename> file in the <filename>info</filename> directory serves as the
departure point for the whole Info system.  From it, you can reach the
`Top' nodes of each of the documents in a complete Info system.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>URI syntax for Info</primary></indexterm>
<para>If you wish to refer to an Info file in a URI, you can use the
(unofficial) syntax exemplified in the following.  This works with
Emacs/W3, for example:
<programlisting>
info:///usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press
info:emacs#Dissociated%20Press
info://localhost/usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press
</programlisting>

<para>The <command>info</command> program itself does not follow URI's of any kind.

<para>A Texinfo file can be formatted and typeset as a printed book or manual.
To do this, you need TeX, a powerful, sophisticated typesetting
program written by Donald Knuth.<footnote><para>You can also use the <ulink url='ftp://tug.org/texi2roff.tar.gz'><literal>texi2roff</literal></ulink> program if you do not have TeX; since Texinfo is designed for use with TeX, <literal>texi2roff</literal> is not described here.  <literal>texi2roff</literal> is not part of the standard GNU distribution and is not maintained or up-to-date with all the Texinfo features described in this manual.</para></footnote>
</para>
<para>A Texinfo-based book is similar to any other typeset, printed work: it
can have a title page, copyright page, table of contents, and preface,
as well as chapters, numbered or unnumbered sections and subsections,
page headers, cross references, footnotes, and indices.
</para>
<para>You can use Texinfo to write a book without ever having the intention
of converting it into online information.  You can use Texinfo for
writing a printed novel, and even to write a printed memo, although
this latter application is not recommended since electronic mail is so
much easier.
</para>
<para>TeX is a general purpose typesetting program.  Texinfo provides a
file <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> that contains information (definitions or
<emphasis role='bold'>macros</emphasis>) that TeX uses when it typesets a Texinfo file.
(<filename>texinfo.tex</filename> tells TeX how to convert the Texinfo @-commands
to TeX commands, which TeX can then process to create the typeset
document.)  <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> contains the specifications for printing
a document.  You can get the latest version of <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> from
<ulink url='ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo.tex'>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo.tex</ulink>.
</para>
<para>Most often, documents are printed on 8.5 inch by 11 inch pages
(216mm by 280mm; this is the default size), but you can also
print for 7 inch by 9.25 inch pages (178mm by 235mm; the
<literal>@smallbook</literal> size) or on A4 or A5 size paper (<literal>@afourpaper</literal>,
<literal>@afivepaper</literal>).  (See <link linkend='smallbook'>Printing ``Small'' Books</link>.
Also, see <link linkend='a-four-paper'>Printing on A4 Paper</link>.)
</para>
<para>By changing the parameters in <filename>texinfo.tex</filename>, you can change the
size of the printed document.  In addition, you can change the style in
which the printed document is formatted; for example, you can change the
sizes and fonts used, the amount of indentation for each paragraph, the
degree to which words are hyphenated, and the like.  By changing the
specifications, you can make a book look dignified, old and serious, or
light-hearted, young and cheery.
</para>
<para>TeX is freely distributable.  It is written in a superset of Pascal
called WEB and can be compiled either in Pascal or (by using a
conversion program that comes with the TeX distribution) in C.
(See TeX Mode: (emacs), for information
about TeX.)
</para>
<para>TeX is very powerful and has a great many features.  Because a
Texinfo file must be able to present information both on a
character-only terminal in Info form and in a typeset book, the
formatting commands that Texinfo supports are necessarily
limited.

<indexterm><primary>DCM_AT-commands</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Formatting commands</primary></indexterm>

<para>In a Texinfo file, the commands that tell TeX how to typeset the
printed manual and tell <literal>makeinfo</literal> and
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> how to create an Info file are preceded
by <literal>@</literal>; they are called <emphasis role='bold'>@-commands</emphasis>.  For example,
<literal>@node</literal> is the command to indicate a node and <literal>@chapter</literal>
is the command to indicate the start of a chapter.
</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Please note:</emphasis> All the @-commands, with the exception of the
<literal>@TeX{}</literal> command, must be written entirely in lower
case.
</para></blockquote>
<para>The Texinfo @-commands are a strictly limited set of constructs.  The
strict limits make it possible for Texinfo files to be understood both
by TeX and by the code that converts them into Info files.  You can
display Info files on any terminal that displays alphabetic and
numeric characters.  Similarly, you can print the output generated by
TeX on a wide variety of printers.
</para>
<para>Depending on what they do or what arguments<footnote><para>The word <emphasis role='bold'>argument</emphasis> comes from the way it is used in mathematics and does not refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the information presented to the command.  According to the <citetitle>Oxford English Dictionary</citetitle>, the word derives from the Latin for <emphasis role='bold'>to make clear, prove</emphasis>; thus it came to mean `the evidence offered as proof', which is to say, `the information offered', which led to its mathematical meaning.  In its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean `to assert in a manner against which others may make counter assertions', which led to the meaning of `argument' as a dispute.</para></footnote> they take, you
need to write @-commands on lines of their own or as part of
sentences:

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Braces, when to use</primary></indexterm>
As a general rule, a command requires braces if it mingles among other
text; but it does not need braces if it starts a line of its own.  The
non-alphabetic commands, such as <literal>@:</literal>, are exceptions to the rule;
they do not need braces.
</para>
<para>As you gain experience with Texinfo, you will rapidly learn how to
write the different commands: the different ways to write commands
make it easier to write and read Texinfo files than if all commands
followed exactly the same syntax.  (For details about @-command

<indexterm><primary>Tabs; don't use!</primary></indexterm>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Caution:</emphasis> Do not use tabs in a Texinfo file (except in verbatim
modes) !  TeX uses variable-width fonts, which means that it is
impractical at best to define a tab to work in all circumstances.
Consequently, TeX treats tabs like single spaces, and that is not
what they look like.  Furthermore, <literal>makeinfo</literal> does nothing special
with tabs, and thus a tab character in your input file may appear
differently in the output, for example, in an indented example.
</para>
<para>
To avoid this problem, Texinfo mode causes GNU Emacs to insert multiple
spaces when you press the <keycap>TAB</keycap> key.
</para>
<para>
Also, you can run <literal>untabify</literal> in Emacs to convert tabs in a region
to multiple spaces.

<sect2 id='comments'><title id='comments-title'>Comments</title>

<para>You can write comments in a Texinfo file that will not appear in
either the Info file or the printed manual by using the
<literal>@comment</literal> command (which may be abbreviated to <literal>@c</literal>).
Such comments are for the person who revises the Texinfo file.  All the
text on a line that follows either <literal>@comment</literal> or <literal>@c</literal> is a
comment; the rest of the line does not appear in either the Info file
or the printed manual. (Often, you can write the <literal>@comment</literal> or
<literal>@c</literal> in the middle of a line, and only the text that follows after
the <literal>@comment</literal> or <literal>@c</literal> command does not appear; but some
commands, such as <literal>@settitle</literal> and <literal>@setfilename</literal>, work on a
whole line.  You cannot use <literal>@comment</literal> or <literal>@c</literal> in a line
beginning with such a command.)

<para>By convention, the names of Texinfo files end with one of the
extensions <filename>.texinfo</filename>, <filename>.texi</filename>, <filename>.txi</filename>, or <filename>.tex</filename>.
The longer extension is preferred since it describes more clearly to a
human reader the nature of the file.  The shorter extensions are for
operating systems that cannot handle long file names.
</para>
<para>In order to be made into a printed manual and an Info file, a Texinfo
file <emphasis role='bold'>must</emphasis> begin with lines like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@setfilename info-file-name
@settitle name-of-manual

</programlisting>

<para>
The contents of the file follow this beginning, and then you <emphasis role='bold'>must</emphasis> end
a Texinfo file with a line like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@bye
</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>input (TeX command)</primary></indexterm>
<para>
The <literal>\input texinfo</literal> line tells TeX to use the
<filename>texinfo.tex</filename> file, which tells TeX how to translate the Texinfo
@-commands into TeX typesetting commands.  (Note the use of the
backslash, <literal>\</literal>; this is correct for TeX.)  The
<literal>@setfilename</literal> line provides a name for the Info file and tells
TeX to open auxiliary files.  The <literal>@settitle</literal> line specifies a
title for the page headers (or footers) of the printed manual, and the
default document description title for the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> in HTML format.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@bye</literal> line at the end of the file on a line of its own tells
the formatters that the file is ended and to stop formatting.
</para>
<para>Usually, you will not use quite such a spare format, but will include
mode setting and start-of-header and end-of-header lines at the
beginning of a Texinfo file, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@c %**start of header
@setfilename info-file-name
@settitle name-of-manual
@c %**end of header

</programlisting>

<para>
In the first line, <literal>-*-texinfo-*-</literal> causes Emacs to switch into
Texinfo mode when you edit the file.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@c</literal> lines which surround the <literal>@setfilename</literal> and
<literal>@settitle</literal> lines are optional, but you need them in order to
run TeX or Info on just part of the file.  (See <link linkend='start-of-header'>Start of Header</link>,
for more information.)
</para>
<para>Furthermore, you will usually provide a Texinfo file with a title
page, indices, and the like.  But the minimum, which can be useful
for short documents, is just the three lines at the beginning and the
one line at the end.

<para>A bit of history: in the 1970's at CMU, Brian Reid developed a program

printed, not for online documents.  Richard Stallman (RMS) worked on
both Bolio and BoTeX.  He also developed a nifty on-line help format
called Info, and then combined BoTeX and Info to create Texinfo, a
mark up language for text that is intended to be read both on line and
as printed hard copy.

<sect2 id='emacs-editing'><title id='emacs-editing-title'>The Usual GNU Emacs Editing Commands</title>

<para>In most cases, the usual Text mode commands work the same in Texinfo
mode as they do in Text mode.  Texinfo mode adds new editing commands
and tools to GNU Emacs' general purpose editing features.  The major
difference concerns filling.  In Texinfo mode, the paragraph
separation variable and syntax table are redefined so that Texinfo
commands that should be on lines of their own are not inadvertently
included in paragraphs.  Thus, the <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>q</keycap></keycombo> (<literal>fill-paragraph</literal>)
command will refill a paragraph but not mix an indexing command on a
line adjacent to it into the paragraph.
</para>
<para>In addition, Texinfo mode sets the <literal>page-delimiter</literal> variable to
the value of <literal>texinfo-chapter-level-regexp</literal>; by default, this is
a regular expression matching the commands for chapters and their
equivalents, such as appendices.  With this value for the page
delimiter, you can jump from chapter title to chapter title with the
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>]</keycap> (<literal>forward-page</literal>) and <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>[</keycap>
(<literal>backward-page</literal>) commands and narrow to a chapter with the
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>p</keycap> (<literal>narrow-to-page</literal>) command.  (See (emacs), for details about the page commands.)
</para>
<para>You may name a Texinfo file however you wish, but the convention is to
end a Texinfo file name with one of the extensions
<filename>.texinfo</filename>, <filename>.texi</filename>, <filename>.txi</filename>, or <filename>.tex</filename>.  A longer
extension is preferred, since it is explicit, but a shorter extension
may be necessary for operating systems that limit the length of file
names.  GNU Emacs automatically enters Texinfo mode when you visit a
file with a <filename>.texinfo</filename>, <filename>.texi</filename> or <filename>.txi</filename>
extension.  Also, Emacs switches to Texinfo mode
when you visit a
file that has <literal>-*-texinfo-*-</literal> in its first line.  If ever you are
in another mode and wish to switch to Texinfo mode, type <literal>M-x texinfo-mode</literal>.
</para>
<para>Like all other Emacs features, you can customize or enhance Texinfo
mode as you wish.  In particular, the keybindings are very easy to
change.  The keybindings described here are the default or standard
ones.

<para>To put a command such as <literal>@code{&hellip;}</literal> around an

This makes it easy to edit existing plain text.
The value of the prefix argument tells Emacs how many words following
point to include between braces---<literal>1</literal> for one word, <literal>2</literal> for
two words, and so on.  Use a negative argument to enclose the previous
word or words.  If you do not specify a prefix argument, Emacs inserts
the @-command string and positions the cursor between the braces.  This
feature works only for those @-commands that operate on a word or words
within one line, such as <literal>@kbd</literal> and <literal>@var</literal>.

<para>This set of insert commands was created after analyzing the frequency

command that works differently from the other insert commands.  It
inserts a node's section or chapter title in the space for the
description in a menu entry line.  (A menu entry has three parts, the
entry name, the node name, and the description.  Only the node name is
required, but a description helps explain what the node is about.

the title that goes with the node name, and inserts the title as a
description; it positions point at beginning of the inserted text so you
can edit it.  The function does not insert the title if the menu entry
line already contains a description.
</para>
<para>This command is only an aid to writing descriptions; it does not do the
whole job.  You must edit the inserted text since a title tends to use
the same words as a node name but a useful description uses different
words.

<para>Texinfo mode provides commands for automatically creating or updating
menus and node pointers.  The commands are called ``update'' commands
because their most frequent use is for updating a Texinfo file after you
have worked on it; but you can use them to insert the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers into an <literal>@node</literal> line that has none
and to create menus in a file that has none.
</para>
<para>If you do not use the updating commands, you need to write menus and
node pointers by hand, which is a tedious task.
</para>


<sect3 id='updating-commands'><title id='updating-commands-title'>Updating Commands</title>
<para>You can use the updating commands to:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>insert or update the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers of a
node,
</para>
</listitem>

<para>insert or update the menu for a section, and
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>You can also use the commands to update all the nodes and menus in a
region or in a whole Texinfo file.
</para>
<para>The updating commands work only with conventional Texinfo files, which
are structured hierarchically like books.  In such files, a structuring
command line must follow closely after each <literal>@node</literal> line, except
for the `Top' <literal>@node</literal> line.  (A <emphasis role='bold'>structuring command line</emphasis> is
a line beginning with <literal>@chapter</literal>, <literal>@section</literal>, or other
similar command.)
</para>
<para>You can write the structuring command line on the line that follows
immediately after an <literal>@node</literal> line or else on the line that
follows after a single <literal>@comment</literal> line or a single
<literal>@ifinfo</literal> line.  You cannot interpose more than one line between
the <literal>@node</literal> line and the structuring command line; and you may
interpose only an <literal>@comment</literal> line or an <literal>@ifinfo</literal> line.
</para>
<para>Commands which work on a whole buffer require that the `Top' node be
followed by a node with an <literal>@chapter</literal> or equivalent-level command.
The menu updating commands will not create a main or master menu for a
Texinfo file that has only <literal>@chapter</literal>-level nodes!  The menu
updating commands only create menus <emphasis>within</emphasis> nodes for lower level
nodes.  To create a menu of chapters, you must provide a `Top'
node.
</para>
<para>The menu updating commands remove menu entries that refer to other Info
files since they do not refer to nodes within the current buffer.  This
is a deficiency.  Rather than use menu entries, you can use cross
references to refer to other Info files.  None of the updating commands
affect cross references.
</para>
<para>Texinfo mode has five updating commands that are used most often: two
are for updating the node pointers or menu of a single node (or a
region); two are for updating every node pointer and menu in a file;
and one, the <literal>texinfo-master-menu</literal> command, is for creating a
master menu for a complete file, and optionally, for updating every
node and menu in the whole Texinfo file.
</para>
<para>The <literal>texinfo-master-menu</literal> command is the primary command:

With an argument (prefix argument, <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u,</keycap></keycombo> if interactive), first create or
update all the nodes and all the regular menus in the buffer before
constructing the master menu.  (See <link linkend='the-top-node'>The Top Node and Master Menu</link>, for more about a master menu.)

For <literal>texinfo-master-menu</literal> to work, the Texinfo file must have a
`Top' node and at least one subsequent node.

After extensively editing a Texinfo file, you can type the following:

<programlisting>

Whenever <literal>texinfo-make-menu</literal> updates an existing menu, the
descriptions from that menu are incorporated into the new menu.  This
is done by copying descriptions from the existing menu to the entries

updates it; but the command does not create a new master menu if none

that.)

When working on a document that does not merit a master menu, you can
type the following:

<para>The <literal>texinfo-column-for-description</literal> variable specifies the
column to which menu descriptions are indented.  By default, the value
is 32 although it is often useful to reduce it to as low as 24.  You
can set the variable with the <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>edit</keycap><keycap>options</keycap></keycombo> command

<para>To use the updating commands, you must organize the Texinfo file
hierarchically with chapters, sections, subsections, and the like.
When you construct the hierarchy of the manual, do not `jump down'
more than one level at a time: you can follow the `Top' node with a
chapter, but not with a section; you can follow a chapter with a
section, but not with a subsection.  However, you may `jump up' any
number of levels at one time---for example, from a subsection to a
chapter.
</para>
<para>Each <literal>@node</literal> line, with the exception of the line for the `Top'
node, must be followed by a line with a structuring command such as
<literal>@chapter</literal>, <literal>@section</literal>, or
<literal>@unnumberedsubsec</literal>.
</para>
<para>Each <literal>@node</literal> line/structuring-command line combination
must look either like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@node     Comments,  Minimum, Conventions, Overview
@comment  node-name, next,    previous,    up
@section Comments

</programlisting>

<para>or like this (without the <literal>@comment</literal> line):
</para>
<programlisting>

@node Comments, Minimum, Conventions, Overview
@section Comments

</programlisting>

<para>
In this example, `Comments' is the name of both the node and the
section.  The next node is called `Minimum' and the previous node is
called `Conventions'.  The `Comments' section is within the `Overview'
node, which is specified by the `Up' pointer.  (Instead of an
<literal>@comment</literal> line, you may also write an <literal>@ifinfo</literal> line.)
</para>
<para>If a file has a `Top' node, it must be called <literal>top</literal> or <literal>Top</literal>
and be the first node in the file.
</para>
<para>The menu updating commands create a menu of sections within a chapter,
a menu of subsections within a section, and so on.  This means that
you must have a `Top' node if you want a menu of chapters.
</para>
<para>Incidentally, the <literal>makeinfo</literal> command will create an Info file for a
hierarchically organized Texinfo file that lacks `Next', `Previous' and
`Up' pointers.  Thus, if you can be sure that your Texinfo file will be
formatted with <literal>makeinfo</literal>, you have no need for the update node
commands.  (See <link linkend='creating-an-info-file'>Creating an Info File</link>, for more information about
<literal>makeinfo</literal>.)  However, both <literal>makeinfo</literal> and the
<literal>texinfo-format-&hellip;</literal> commands require that you insert menus in
the file.

<sect3 id='other-updating-commands'><title id='other-updating-commands-title'>Other Updating Commands</title>

<para>In addition to the five major updating commands, Texinfo mode
possesses several less frequently used updating commands:

<indexterm><primary>texinfo-insert-node-lines</primary></indexterm>
</entry>
<entry>Insert <literal>@node</literal> lines before the <literal>@chapter</literal>,
<literal>@section</literal>, and other sectioning commands wherever they are
missing throughout a region in a Texinfo file.

With an argument (<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u</keycap></keycombo> as prefix argument, if interactive), the
<literal>texinfo-insert-node-lines</literal> command not only inserts
<literal>@node</literal> lines but also inserts the chapter or section titles as
the names of the corresponding nodes.  In addition, it inserts the
titles as node names in pre-existing <literal>@node</literal> lines that lack
names.  Since node names should be more concise than section or
chapter titles, you must manually edit node names so inserted.

For example, the following marks a whole buffer as a region and inserts
<literal>@node</literal> lines and titles throughout:

<programlisting>
C-x h C-u M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
</programlisting>

This command inserts titles as node names in <literal>@node</literal> lines; the
<literal>texinfo-start-menu-description</literal> command (see <link linkend='inserting'>Inserting Frequently Used Commands</link>) inserts titles as descriptions in
menu entries, a different action.  However, in both cases, you need to
edit the inserted text.

are not strictly necessary.)  With an argument (prefix argument, if

</para>
<programlisting>
C-u C-c C-u m
C-u M-x texinfo-master-menu

<para>
This updates all the nodes and menus.  Then type the following to create
an Info file:
</para>
<programlisting>
C-c C-m C-b
M-x makeinfo-buffer

<para>For TeX or the Info formatting commands to work, the file <emphasis>must</emphasis>
include a line that has <literal>@setfilename</literal> in its header.

<para>Typesetting and printing a Texinfo file is a multi-step process in which
you first create a file for printing (called a DVI file), and then
print the file.  Optionally, you may also create indices.  To do this,
you must run the <literal>texindex</literal> command after first running the
<literal>tex</literal> typesetting command; and then you must run the <literal>tex</literal>
command again.  Or else run the <literal>texi2dvi</literal> command which
automatically creates indices as needed (see <link linkend='format-with-texi-two-dvi'>Format with texi2dvi</link>).
</para>
<para>Often, when you are writing a document, you want to typeset and print
only part of a file to see what it will look like.  You can use the
<literal>texinfo-tex-region</literal> and related commands for this purpose.  Use
the <literal>texinfo-tex-buffer</literal> command to format all of a
buffer.

<sect3 id='start-of-header'><title id='start-of-header-title'>Start of Header</title>
<indexterm><primary>Start of header line</primary></indexterm>

<para>Write a start-of-header line on the second line of a Texinfo file.
Follow the start-of-header line with <literal>@setfilename</literal> and
<literal>@settitle</literal> lines and, optionally, with other command lines, such
as <literal>@smallbook</literal> or <literal>@footnotestyle</literal>; and then by an
end-of-header line (see <link linkend='end-of-header'>End of Header</link>).
</para>
<para>With these lines, you can format part of a Texinfo file for Info or
typeset part for printing.
</para>
<para>A start-of-header line looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@c %**start of header
</programlisting>

<para>The odd string of characters, <literal>%**</literal>, is to ensure that no other
comment is accidentally taken for a start-of-header line.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>Info file requires <literal>DCM_ATsetfilename</literal></primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>setfilename</primary></indexterm>

<para>In order to serve as the primary input file for either <literal>makeinfo</literal>
or TeX, a Texinfo file must contain a line that looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@setfilename info-file-name
</programlisting>

<para>Write the <literal>@setfilename</literal> command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the Info file name.  Do not write anything
else on the line; anything on the line after the command is considered
part of the file name, including what would otherwise be a
comment.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@setfilename</literal> line specifies the name of the output file to
be generated.  This name should be different from the name of the
Texinfo file.  There are two conventions for choosing the name: you can
either remove the extension (such as <literal>.texi</literal>) from the input file
name, or replace it with the <literal>.info</literal> extension.  When producing
HTML output, <literal>makeinfo</literal> will replace any extension with
<literal>html</literal>, or add <literal>.html</literal> if the given name has no extension.
</para>
<para>Some operating systems cannot handle long file names.  You can run into
a problem even when the file name you specify is itself short enough.
This occurs because the Info formatters split a long Info file into
short indirect subfiles, and name them by appending <literal>-1</literal>,
<literal>-2</literal>, &hellip;, <literal>-10</literal>, <literal>-11</literal>, and so on, to the original
file name.  (See <link linkend='tag-and-split-files'>Tag Files and Split Files</link>.)
The subfile name <filename>texinfo.info-10</filename>, for example, is too long for
some systems; so the Info file name for this document is <filename>texinfo</filename>
rather than <filename>texinfo.info</filename>.  When <literal>makeinfo</literal> is running on
operating systems such as MS-DOS which impose grave limits on file
names, it will sometimes remove some characters from the original file
name to leave enough space for the subfile suffix, thus producing files
named <filename>texin-10</filename>, <filename>gcc.i12</filename>, etc.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Ignored before <literal>DCM_ATsetfilename</literal></primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary><literal>\input</literal> source line ignored</primary></indexterm>
<para>The Info formatting commands ignore everything written before the
<literal>@setfilename</literal> line, which is why the very first line of
the file (the <literal>\input</literal> line) does not show up in the output.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@setfilename</literal> line produces no output when you typeset a
manual with TeX, but it is nevertheless essential: it opens the
index, cross-reference, and other auxiliary files used by Texinfo, and
also reads <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename> if that file is present on your system
(see <link linkend='preparing-for-tex'>Preparing for TeX</link>).
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='settitle'><title id='settitle-title'><literal>@settitle</literal>: Set the document title</title>
<indexterm><primary>settitle</primary></indexterm>

<para>In order to be made into a printed manual, a Texinfo file must contain
a line that looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@settitle title
</programlisting>

<para>In the HTML file produced by <command>makeinfo</command>, <literal>title</literal> serves as
the default document description in the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> part; see
<link linkend='documentdescription'>documentdescription</link>, for how to change that.
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@settitle</literal> command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the title.  This tells TeX the title
to use in a header or footer.  Do not write anything else on the line;
anything on the line after the command is considered part of the
title, including a comment.
</para>
<para>Conventionally, when TeX formats a Texinfo file for double-sided
output, the title is printed in the left-hand (even-numbered) page
headings and the current chapter title is printed in the right-hand
(odd-numbered) page headings.  (TeX learns the title of each chapter
from each <literal>@chapter</literal> command.)  Page footers are not
printed.
</para>
<para>Even if you are printing in a single-sided style, TeX looks for an
<literal>@settitle</literal> command line, in case you include the manual title
in the heading. 
</para>
<para>The <literal>@settitle</literal> command should precede everything that generates
actual output in TeX.
</para>
<para>Although the title in the <literal>@settitle</literal> command is usually the
same as the title on the title page, it does not affect the title as
it appears on the title page.  Thus, the two do not need not match
exactly;  and the title in the <literal>@settitle</literal> command can be a
shortened or expanded version of the title as it appears on the title
page. (See <link linkend='titlepage'><literal>@titlepage</literal></link>.)
</para>
<para>TeX prints page headings only for that text that comes after the
<literal>@end titlepage</literal> command in the Texinfo file, or that comes
after an <literal>@headings</literal> command that turns on headings.
(See <link linkend='headings-on-off'>The <literal>@headings</literal> Command</link>, for more
information.)
</para>
<para>You may, if you wish, create your own, customized headings and
footings.  See <link linkend='headings'>Page Headings</link>, for a detailed discussion
of this process.

<indexterm><primary>Summary of document</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>&lt;meta&gt; HTML tag, and document description</primary></indexterm>

<para>When producing HTML output for a document, <command>makeinfo</command> writes a
<literal>&lt;meta&gt;</literal> element in the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> to give some idea of the
content of the document.  By default, this <emphasis role='bold'>description</emphasis> is the title
of the document, taken from the <literal>@settitle</literal> command
(see <link linkend='settitle'><literal>@settitle</literal>: Set the document title</link>).  To change this, use the <literal>@documentdescription</literal>
environment, as in:
</para>
<programlisting>
@documentdescription
descriptive text
@end documendescription
</programlisting>

<para>
This will produce the following output in the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> of the HTML:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;meta name=description content="descriptive text"&gt;
</programlisting>

<para><literal>@documentdescription</literal> must be specified before the first node of
the document.

<indexterm><primary>Starting chapters</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Pages, starting odd</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>setchapternewpage</primary></indexterm>

<para>In an officially bound book, text is usually printed on both sides of
the paper, chapters start on right-hand pages, and right-hand pages have
odd numbers.  But in short reports, text often is printed only on one
side of the paper.  Also in short reports, chapters sometimes do not
start on new pages, but are printed on the same page as the end of the
preceding chapter, after a small amount of vertical whitespace.
</para>
<para>You can use the <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command with various
arguments to specify how TeX should start chapters and whether it
should format headers for printing on one or both sides of the paper
(single-sided or double-sided printing).
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command at the beginning of a
line followed by its argument.
</para>
<para>For example, you would write the following to cause each chapter to
start on a fresh odd-numbered page:
</para>
<programlisting>
@setchapternewpage odd
</programlisting>

<para>You can specify one of three alternatives with the
<literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>

<row><entry><literal>@setchapternewpage off</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Cause TeX to typeset a new chapter on the same page as the last
chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also, cause TeX to
format page headers for single-sided printing.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@setchapternewpage on</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Cause TeX to start new chapters on new pages and to format page
headers for single-sided printing.  This is the form most often used for
short reports or personal printing. This is the default.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@setchapternewpage odd</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Cause TeX to start new chapters on new, odd-numbered pages
(right-handed pages) and to typeset for double-sided printing.  This is
the form most often used for books and manuals.
</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<para>Texinfo does not have an <literal>@setchapternewpage even</literal> command,
because there is no printing tradition of starting chapters or books on
an even-numbered page.
</para>
<para>If you don't like the default headers that <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal>
sets, you can explicit control them with the <literal>@headings</literal> command.
See <link linkend='headings-on-off'>The <literal>@headings</literal> Command</link>.
</para>
<para>At the beginning of a manual or book, pages are not numbered---for
example, the title and copyright pages of a book are not numbered.  By
convention, table of contents and frontmatter pages are numbered with
roman numerals and not in sequence with the rest of the document.
</para>
<para>Since an Info file does not have pages, the <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal>
command has no effect on it.
</para>
<para>We recommend not including any <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command in
your manual sources at all, since the desired output is not intrinsic to
the document.  Instead, if you don't want the default option (no blank
pages, same headers on all pages) use the <option>--texinfo</option> option to
<command>texi2dvi</command> to specify the output you want.

<para>The Texinfo processors may insert whitespace at the beginning of the

end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  (If you write
the command between the start-of-header and end-of-header lines, the
region formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.)
</para>
<para>A peculiarity of the <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> and
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> commands is that they do not indent (nor
fill) paragraphs that contain <literal>@w</literal> or <literal>@*</literal> commands.

<sect2 id='info-summary-and-permissions'><title id='info-summary-and-permissions-title'>Summary and Copying Permissions for Info</title>

<para>The title page and the copyright page appear only in the printed copy of
the manual; therefore, the same information must be inserted in a
section that appears only in the Info file.  This section usually
contains a brief description of the contents of the Info file, a
copyright notice, and copying permissions.
</para>
<para>The copyright notice should read:
</para>
<programlisting>
Copyright year copyright-owner
</programlisting>

<para>
and be put on a line by itself.
</para>
<para>Standard text for the copyright permissions of free manuals is contained
in an appendix to this manual (see <link linkend='documentation-copying'>GNU Free Documentation License</link>).
</para>
<para>The permissions text appears in an Info file <emphasis>before</emphasis> the first
node.  This mean that a reader does <emphasis>not</emphasis> see this text when
reading the file using Info (except when using the advanced Info command
<keycap>g</keycap><keycap>*</keycap>).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id='titlepage-and-copyright-page'><title id='titlepage-and-copyright-page-title'>The Title and Copyright Pages</title>

<para>A manual's name and author are usually printed on a title page.
Sometimes copyright information is printed on the title page as well;
more often, copyright information is printed on the back of the title
page.
</para>
<para>The title and copyright pages appear in the printed manual, but not in the
Info file.  Because of this, it is possible to use several slightly
obscure TeX typesetting commands that cannot be used in an Info file.
In addition, this part of the beginning of a Texinfo file contains the text
of the copying permissions that will appear in the printed manual.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Titlepage, for plain text</primary></indexterm>
<para>You may wish to include titlepage-like information for plain text
output.  Simply place any such leading material between <literal>@ifinfo</literal>
and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal>; <command>makeinfo</command> includes this in its plain
text output.  It will not show up in the Info readers.

<indexterm><primary>Title page</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>titlepage</primary></indexterm>

<para>Start the material for the title page and following copyright page
with <literal>@titlepage</literal> on a line by itself and end it with
<literal>@end titlepage</literal> on a line by itself.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command starts a new page and turns on page
numbering.  (See <link linkend='headings'>Page Headings</link>, for details about how to
generate page headings.)  All the material that you want to appear on
unnumbered pages should be put between the <literal>@titlepage</literal> and
<literal>@end titlepage</literal> commands.  You can force the table of contents to
appear there with the <literal>@setcontentsaftertitlepage</literal> command
(see <link linkend='contents'>Contents</link>).
</para>
<indexterm><primary>page, within <literal>DCM_ATtitlepage</literal></primary></indexterm>
<para>By using the <literal>@page</literal> command you can force a page break within the
region delineated by the <literal>@titlepage</literal> and <literal>@end titlepage</literal>
commands and thereby create more than one unnumbered page.  This is how
the copyright page is produced.  (The <literal>@titlepage</literal> command might
perhaps have been better named the <literal>@titleandadditionalpages</literal>
command, but that would have been rather long!)
</para>
<para>When you write a manual about a computer program, you should write the
version of the program to which the manual applies on the title page.
If the manual changes more frequently than the program or is independent
of it, you should also include an edition number<footnote><para>We have found that it is helpful to refer to versions of manuals as `editions' and versions of programs as `versions'; otherwise, we find we are liable to confuse each other in conversation by referring to both the documentation and the software with the same words.</para></footnote> for the manual.
This helps readers keep track of which manual is for which version of
the program.  (The `Top' node should also contain this information; see
<link linkend='makeinfo-top'><literal>@top</literal></link>.)
</para>
<para>Texinfo provides two main methods for creating a title page.  One method
uses the <literal>@titlefont</literal>, <literal>@sp</literal>, and <literal>@center</literal> commands
to generate a title page in which the words on the page are
centered.
</para>
<para>The second method uses the <literal>@title</literal>, <literal>@subtitle</literal>, and
<literal>@author</literal> commands to create a title page with black rules under
the title and author lines and the subtitle text set flush to the
right hand side of the page.  With this method, you do not specify any
of the actual formatting of the title page.  You specify the text
you want, and Texinfo does the formatting.
</para>
<para>You may use either method, or you may combine them; see the examples in
the sections below.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>shorttitlepage</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Bastard title page</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Title page, bastard</primary></indexterm>
<para>For extremely simple applications, and for the bastard title page in
traditional book front matter, Texinfo also provides a command
<literal>@shorttitlepage</literal> which takes a single argument as the title.  The
argument is typeset on a page by itself and followed by a blank page.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='titlefont-center-sp'><title id='titlefont-center-sp-title'><literal>@titlefont</literal>, <literal>@center</literal>, and <literal>@sp</literal></title>
<indexterm><primary>titlefont</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>center</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>sp (titlepage line spacing)</primary></indexterm>

<para>You can use the <literal>@titlefont</literal>, <literal>@sp</literal>, and <literal>@center</literal>
commands to create a title page for a printed document.  (This is the
first of the two methods for creating a title page in Texinfo.)
</para>
<para>Use the <literal>@titlefont</literal> command to select a large font suitable for
the title itself.  You can use <literal>@titlefont</literal> more than once if you
have an especially long title.
</para>

<para>For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@titlefont{Texinfo}
</programlisting>

<para>Use the <literal>@center</literal> command at the beginning of a line to center
the remaining text on that line.  Thus,
</para>
<programlisting>
@center @titlefont{Texinfo}
</programlisting>

<para>
centers the title, which in this example is ``Texinfo'' printed
in the title font.
</para>
<para>Use the <literal>@sp</literal> command to insert vertical space.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@sp 2
</programlisting>

<para>
This inserts two blank lines on the printed page.  (See <link linkend='sp'><literal>@sp</literal></link>, for more information about the <literal>@sp</literal>
command.)
</para>
<para>A template for this method looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@titlepage
@sp 10
@center @titlefont{name-of-manual-when-printed}
@sp 2
@center subtitle-if-any
@sp 2
@center author
&hellip;
@end titlepage

</programlisting>

<para>The spacing of the example fits an 8.5 by 11 inch manual.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>title</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>subtitle</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>author</primary></indexterm>

<para>You can use the <literal>@title</literal>, <literal>@subtitle</literal>, and <literal>@author</literal>
commands to create a title page in which the vertical and horizontal
spacing is done for you automatically.  This contrasts with the method
described in the previous section, in which the <literal>@sp</literal> command is
needed to adjust vertical spacing.
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@title</literal>, <literal>@subtitle</literal>, or <literal>@author</literal>
commands at the beginning of a line followed by the title, subtitle,
or author.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@title</literal> command produces a line in which the title is set
flush to the left-hand side of the page in a larger than normal font.
The title is underlined with a black rule.  Only a single line is
allowed; the <literal>@*</literal> command may not be used to break the title into
two lines.  To handle very long titles, you may find it profitable to
use both <literal>@title</literal> and <literal>@titlefont</literal>; see the final example in
this section.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@subtitle</literal> command sets subtitles in a normal-sized font
flush to the right-hand side of the page.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@author</literal> command sets the names of the author or authors in
a middle-sized font flush to the left-hand side of the page on a line
near the bottom of the title page.  The names are underlined with a
black rule that is thinner than the rule that underlines the title.
(The black rule only occurs if the <literal>@author</literal> command line is
followed by an <literal>@page</literal> command line.)
</para>
<para>There are two ways to use the <literal>@author</literal> command: you can write
the name or names on the remaining part of the line that starts with
an <literal>@author</literal> command:
</para>
<programlisting>
@author by Jane Smith and John Doe
</programlisting>

<para>
or you can write the names one above each other by using two (or more)
<literal>@author</literal> commands:
</para>
<programlisting>

@author Jane Smith
@author John Doe

</programlisting>

<para>
(Only the bottom name is underlined with a black rule.)
</para>

<para>A template for this method looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@titlepage
@title name-of-manual-when-printed
@subtitle subtitle-if-any
@subtitle second-subtitle
@author author
@page
&hellip;
@end titlepage

</programlisting>

<para>You may also combine the <literal>@titlefont</literal> method described in the
previous section and <literal>@title</literal> method described in this one.  This
may be useful if you have a very long title.  Here is a real-life example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@titlepage
@titlefont{GNU Software}
@sp 1
@title for MS-Windows and MS-DOS
@subtitle Edition @value{e} for Release @value{cde}
@author by Daniel Hagerty, Melissa Weisshaus

<para>When the copyright notice is on the back of the title page, that page

<programlisting>
@vskip 0pt plus 1filll
</programlisting>

<para>
This is a TeX command that is not supported by the Info formatting
commands.  The <literal>@vskip</literal> command inserts whitespace.  The
<literal>0pt plus 1filll</literal> means to put in zero points of mandatory whitespace,
and as much optional whitespace as needed to push the
following text to the bottom of the page.  Note the use of three
<literal>l</literal>s in the word <literal>filll</literal>; this is the correct usage in
TeX.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>copyright</primary></indexterm>
<para>In a printed manual, the <literal>@copyright{}</literal> command generates a
<literal>c</literal> inside a circle.  (In Info, it generates <literal>(C)</literal>.)  The
copyright notice itself has the following legally defined sequence:
</para>
<programlisting>
Copyright &copy; year copyright-owner
</programlisting>

<para>It is customary to put information on how to get a manual after the
copyright notice, followed by the copying permissions for the manual.
</para>
<para>Permissions must be given here as well as in the summary segment within
<literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal> that immediately follows the
header since this text appears only in the printed manual and the
<literal>ifinfo</literal> text appears only in the Info file.

<para>An <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command on a line by itself not only marks
the end of the title and copyright pages, but also causes TeX to start
generating page headings and page numbers.
</para>
<para>To repeat what is said elsewhere,  Texinfo has two standard page heading
formats, one for documents which are printed on one side of each sheet of paper
(single-sided printing), and the other for documents which are printed on both
sides of each sheet (double-sided printing).
(See <link linkend='setchapternewpage'><literal>@setchapternewpage</literal></link>.)
You can specify these formats in different ways:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>The conventional way is to write an <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command
before the title page commands, and then have the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command start generating page headings in the manner desired.
(See <link linkend='setchapternewpage'><literal>@setchapternewpage</literal></link>.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Alternatively, you can use the <literal>@headings</literal> command to prevent page
headings from being generated or to start them for either single or
double-sided printing.  (Write an <literal>@headings</literal> command immediately
after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command.  See <link linkend='headings-on-off'>The <literal>@headings</literal> Command</link>, for more information.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Or, you may specify your own page heading and footing format.
See <link linkend='headings'>Page Headings</link>, for detailed
information about page headings and footings.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Most documents are formatted with the standard single-sided or
double-sided format, using <literal>@setchapternewpage odd</literal> for
double-sided printing and no <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command for
single-sided printing.

<indexterm><primary>headings</primary></indexterm>

<para>The <literal>@headings</literal> command is rarely used.  It specifies what kind of
page headings and footings to print on each page.  Usually, this is
controlled by the <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command.  You need the
<literal>@headings</literal> command only if the <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command
does not do what you want, or if you want to turn off pre-defined page
headings prior to defining your own.  Write an <literal>@headings</literal> command
immediately after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command.
</para>
<para>You can use <literal>@headings</literal> as follows:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry><literal>@headings off</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Turn off printing of page headings.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@headings single</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Turn on page headings appropriate for single-sided printing.


</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@headings double</literal>
, <literal>@headings on</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Turn on page headings appropriate for double-sided printing.  The two
commands, <literal>@headings on</literal> and <literal>@headings double</literal>, are
synonymous.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@headings singleafter</literal>
, <literal>@headings doubleafter</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Turn on <literal>single</literal> or <literal>double</literal> headings, respectively, after the
current page is output.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@headings on</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Turn on page headings: <literal>single</literal> if <literal>@setchapternewpage on</literal>, <literal>double</literal> otherwise.
</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<para>For example, suppose you write <literal>@setchapternewpage off</literal> before the
<literal>@titlepage</literal> command to tell TeX to start a new chapter on the
same page as the end of the last chapter.  This command also causes
TeX to typeset page headers for single-sided printing.  To cause
TeX to typeset for double sided printing, write <literal>@headings double</literal> after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command.
</para>
<para>You can stop TeX from generating any page headings at all by
writing <literal>@headings off</literal> on a line of its own immediately after the
line containing the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@end titlepage
@headings off
</programlisting>

<para>
The <literal>@headings off</literal> command overrides the <literal>@end titlepage</literal>
command, which would otherwise cause TeX to print page
headings.

<para>You can also specify your own style of page heading and footing.

<para>The `Top' node is the node from which you enter an Info file.
</para>
<para>A `Top' node should contain a brief description of the Info file and an
extensive, master menu for the whole Info file.
This helps the reader understand what the Info file is
about.  Also, you should write the version number of the program to
which the Info file applies; or, at least, the edition number.
</para>
<para>The contents of the `Top' node should appear only in the Info file; none
of it should appear in printed output, so enclose it between
<literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal> commands.  (TeX does not
print either an <literal>@node</literal> line or a menu; they appear only in Info;
strictly speaking, you are not required to enclose these parts between
<literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal>, but it is simplest to do so.
See <link linkend='conditionals'>Conditionally Visible Text</link>.)

<sect3 id='title-of-top-node'><title id='title-of-top-node-title'>`Top' Node Title</title>

line containing the title of the document immediately after the
<literal>@node Top</literal> line (see <link linkend='makeinfo-top-command'>The <literal>@top</literal> Sectioning Command</link>, for more information).
</para>
<para>For example, the beginning of the Top node of this manual contains an
<literal>@top</literal> sectioning command, a short description, and edition and
version information.  It looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The third and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other, lower
level nodes, often ordered by chapter.  This way, rather than go
through an intermediary menu, an inquirer can go directly to a
particular node when searching for specific information.  These menu
items are not required; add them if you think they are a
convenience.  If you do use them, put <literal>@detailmenu</literal> before the
first one, and <literal>@end detailmenu</literal> after the last; otherwise,

<para>Each section in the menu can be introduced by a descriptive line.  So

<para>To print an index means to include it as part of a manual or Info
file.  This does not happen automatically just because you use
<literal>@cindex</literal> or other index-entry generating commands in the
Texinfo file; those just cause the raw data for the index to be
accumulated.  To generate an index, you must include the
<literal>@printindex</literal> command at the place in the document where you
want the index to appear.  Also, as part of the process of creating a
printed manual, you must run a program called <literal>texindex</literal>
(see <link linkend='hardcopy'>Hardcopy</link>) to sort the raw data to produce a sorted
index file.  The sorted index file is what is actually used to
print the index.
</para>
<para>Texinfo offers six different types of predefined index: the concept
index, the function index, the variables index, the keystroke index, the
program index, and the data type index (see <link linkend='predefined-indices'>Predefined Indices</link>).  Each
index type has a two-letter name: <literal>cp</literal>, <literal>fn</literal>, <literal>vr</literal>,
<literal>ky</literal>, <literal>pg</literal>, and <literal>tp</literal>.  You may merge indices, or put them
into separate sections (see <link linkend='combining-indices'>Combining Indices</link>); or you may define
your own indices (see <link linkend='new-indices'>Defining New Indices</link>).
</para>
<para>The <literal>@printindex</literal> command takes a two-letter index name, reads
the corresponding sorted index file and formats it appropriately into
an index.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@printindex</literal> command does not generate a chapter heading
for the index.  Consequently, you should precede the
<literal>@printindex</literal> command with a suitable section or chapter command
(usually <literal>@unnumbered</literal>) to supply the chapter heading and put
the index into the table of contents.  Precede the <literal>@unnumbered</literal>
command with an <literal>@node</literal> line.
</para>

<para>For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@node Variable Index, Concept Index, Function Index, Top
@comment    node-name,         next,       previous, up
@unnumbered Variable Index

@printindex vr



@node     Concept Index,     , Variable Index, Top
@comment      node-name, next,       previous, up
@unnumbered Concept Index

@printindex cp

</programlisting>

<para>
Readers often prefer that the concept index come last in a book,
since that makes it easiest to find.  Having just one index helps
readers also, since then they have only one place to look
(see <link linkend='synindex'>synindex</link>).

<indexterm><primary>shortcontents</primary></indexterm>

<para>The <literal>@chapter</literal>, <literal>@section</literal>, and other structuring commands
supply the information to make up a table of contents, but they do not
cause an actual table to appear in the manual.  To do this, you must use
the <literal>@contents</literal> and/or <literal>@summarycontents</literal> command(s).
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry><literal>@contents</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Generate a table of contents in a printed manual, including all
chapters, sections, subsections, etc., as well as appendices and
unnumbered chapters.  (Headings generated by the <literal>@heading</literal>
series of commands do not appear in the table of contents.)

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@shortcontents</literal>
, <literal>@summarycontents</literal>
</entry>
<entry>(<literal>@summarycontents</literal> is a synonym for <literal>@shortcontents</literal>; the
two commands are exactly the same.)

Generate a short or summary table of contents that lists only the
chapters (and appendices and unnumbered chapters).  Omit sections, subsections
and subsubsections.  Only a long manual needs a short table
of contents in addition to the full table of contents.

</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<para>Both contents commands should be written on a line by themselves.
The contents commands automatically generate a chapter-like heading at
the top of the first table of contents page, so don't include any
sectioning command such as <literal>@unnumbered</literal> before them.
</para>
<para>Since an Info file uses menus instead of tables of contents, the Info
formatting commands ignore the contents commands.  But the contents are
included in plain text output (generated by <literal>makeinfo --no-headers</literal>), unless <literal>makeinfo</literal> is writing its output to standard
output.
</para>
<para>When <literal>makeinfo</literal> writes a short table of contents while producing
html output, the links in the short table of contents point to
corresponding entries in the full table of contents rather than the text
of the document. The links in the full table of contents point to the
main text of the document.
</para>
<para>The contents commands can be placed either at the very end of the file,
after any indices (see the previous section) and just before the
<literal>@bye</literal> (see the next section), or near the beginning of the file,
after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> (see <link linkend='titlepage'><literal>@titlepage</literal></link>).  The advantage to
the former is that then the contents output is always up to date,
because it reflects the processing just done.  The advantage to the
latter is that the contents are printed in the proper place, thus you do
not need to rearrange the DVI file with <command>dviselect</command> or shuffle
paper.

<para>As an author, you can put the contents commands wherever you prefer.
But if you are a user simply printing a manual, you may wish to print
the contents after the title page even if the author put the contents
commands at the end of the document (as is the case in most existing
Texinfo documents).  You can do this by specifying
<literal>@setcontentsaftertitlepage</literal> and/or
<literal>@setshortcontentsaftertitlepage</literal>.  The first prints only the main
contents after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal>; the second prints both the
short contents and the main contents.  In either case, any subsequent
<literal>@contents</literal> or <literal>@shortcontents</literal> is ignored (unless no
<literal>@end titlepage</literal> is ever encountered).
</para>
<para>You need to include the <literal>@set&hellip;contentsaftertitlepage</literal>
commands early in the document (just after <literal>@setfilename</literal>, for
example).  Or, if you're using <command>texi2dvi</command> (see <link linkend='format-with-texi-two-dvi'>Format with texi2dvi</link>), you can use its <option>--texinfo</option> option to specify this
without altering the source file at all.  For example:

<para>If you wish, you may follow the <literal>@bye</literal> line with notes. These notes

<para>The chapter structuring commands do not create an Info node structure,

are likely to use the chapter structuring commands without using the
node structuring commands is if you are writing a document that
contains no cross references and will never be transformed into Info
format.
</para>
<para>It is unlikely that you will ever write a Texinfo file that is
intended only as an Info file and not as a printable document.  If you
do, you might still use chapter structuring commands to create a

<sect2 id='makeinfo-top'><title id='makeinfo-top-title'><literal>@top</literal></title>

<para>The <literal>@top</literal> command is a special sectioning command that you use
only after an <literal>@node Top</literal> line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.
The <literal>@top</literal> command tells the <literal>makeinfo</literal> formatter which node
is the `Top' node, so it can use it as the root of the node tree if your
manual uses implicit pointers.  It has the same typesetting effect as
<literal>@unnumbered</literal> (see <link linkend='unnumbered-and-appendix'><literal>@unnumbered</literal> and <literal>@appendix</literal></link>).  For detailed information, see <link linkend='makeinfo-top-command'>The <literal>@top</literal> Command</link>.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@top</literal> node and its menu (if any) is conventionally wrapped in
an <literal>@ifnottex</literal> conditional so that it will appear only in Info and
HTML output, not TeX.

<!--   node-name,  next,  previous,  up -->

</sect2>

<sect2 id='chapter'><title id='chapter-title'><literal>@chapter</literal></title>
<indexterm><primary>chapter</primary></indexterm>

<para><literal>@chapter</literal> identifies a chapter in the document.  Write the
command at the beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by
the title of the chapter.
</para>
<para>For example, this chapter in this manual is entitled ``Chapter
Structuring''; the <literal>@chapter</literal> line looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@chapter Chapter Structuring
</programlisting>

<para>In TeX, the <literal>@chapter</literal> command creates a chapter in the
document, specifying the chapter title.  The chapter is numbered
automatically.
</para>
<para>In Info, the <literal>@chapter</literal> command causes the title to appear on a
line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted underneath.  Thus,
in Info, the above example produces the following output:
</para>
<programlisting>
Chapter Structuring
*******************
</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>centerchap</primary></indexterm>
<para>Texinfo also provides a command <literal>@centerchap</literal>, which is analogous
to <literal>@unnumbered</literal>, but centers its argument in the printed output.
This kind of stylistic choice is not usually offered by Texinfo.

corresponds to the structure for the printed output.  It is neither

``Top''.  You can omit writing out these node names if your document is

</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Please Note:</emphasis> `Next' refers to the next node at the same
hierarchical level in the manual, not necessarily to the next node

chapter-level node, for example.  `Next' and `Previous' refer to nodes
at the <emphasis>same</emphasis> hierarchical level.  (The `Top' node contains the
exception to this rule.  Since the `Top' node is the only node at that

a chapter or chapter-level node.)

<para>To go to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Info, you need a menu inside Chapter

<para>In Info format, the `Next' and `Previous' pointers of a node usually
lead to other nodes at the same level---from chapter to chapter or from

up); an `Up' pointer usually leads to a node at the level above (closer
to the `Top' node); and a `Menu' leads to nodes at a level below (closer
to `leaves').  (A cross reference can point to a node at any level;

<indexterm><primary>Node, defined</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>node</primary></indexterm>

<para>A <emphasis role='bold'>node</emphasis> is a segment of text that begins at an <literal>@node</literal>
command and continues until the next <literal>@node</literal> command.  The
definition of node is different from that for chapter or section.  A
chapter may contain sections and a section may contain subsections;
but a node cannot contain subnodes; the text of a node continues only
until the next <literal>@node</literal> command in the file.  A node usually
contains only one chapter structuring command, the one that follows
the <literal>@node</literal> line.  On the other hand, in printed output nodes
are used only for cross references, so a chapter or section may
contain any number of nodes.  Indeed, a chapter usually contains
several nodes, one for each section, subsection, and
subsubsection.
</para>
<para>To create a node, write an <literal>@node</literal> command at the beginning of a
line, and follow it with up to four arguments, separated by commas, on
the rest of the same line.  The first argument is required; it is the
name of this node.  The subsequent arguments are the names of the
`Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers, in that order, and may be omitted
if your Texinfo document is hierarchically organized (see <link linkend='makeinfo-pointer-creation'>makeinfo Pointer Creation</link>).
</para>
<para>You may insert spaces before each name if you wish; the spaces are
ignored.  You must write the name of the node and the names of the
`Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers all on the same line.  Otherwise,
the formatters fail.  (See (info)info, for more information
about nodes in Info.)
</para>
<para>Usually, you write one of the chapter-structuring command lines
immediately after an <literal>@node</literal> line---for example, an
<literal>@section</literal> or <literal>@subsection</literal> line.  (See <link linkend='structuring-command-types'>Structuring Command Types</link>.)
</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Please note:</emphasis> The GNU Emacs Texinfo mode updating commands work
only with Texinfo files in which <literal>@node</literal> lines are followed by chapter
structuring lines.  See <link linkend='updating-requirements'>Updating Requirements</link>.
</para></blockquote>
<para>TeX uses <literal>@node</literal> lines to identify the names to use for cross
references.  For this reason, you must write <literal>@node</literal> lines in a
Texinfo file that you intend to format for printing, even if you do not
intend to format it for Info.  (Cross references, such as the one at the
end of this sentence, are made with <literal>@xref</literal> and related commands;
see <link linkend='cross-references'>Cross References</link>.)
</para>


<sect3 id='node-names'><title id='node-names-title'>Choosing Node and Pointer Names</title>

<indexterm><primary>Node names, choosing</primary></indexterm>
<para>The name of a node identifies the node.  The pointers enable
you to reach other nodes and consist of the names of those nodes.
</para>
<para>Normally, a node's `Up' pointer contains the name of the node whose menu
mentions that node.  The node's `Next' pointer contains the name of the
node that follows that node in that menu and its `Previous' pointer
contains the name of the node that precedes it in that menu.  When a
node's `Previous' node is the same as its `Up' node, both node pointers
name the same node.
</para>
<para>Usually, the first node of a Texinfo file is the `Top' node, and its
`Up' and `Previous' pointers point to the <filename>dir</filename> file, which
contains the main menu for all of Info.
</para>
<para>The `Top' node itself contains the main or master menu for the manual.
Also, it is helpful to include a brief description of the manual in the
`Top' node.  See <link linkend='first-node'>First Node</link>, for information on how to write the
first node of a Texinfo file.
</para>
<para>Even when you explicitly specify all pointers, that does not mean you
can write the nodes in the Texinfo source file in an arbitrary order!
Because TeX processes the file sequentially, irrespective of node
pointers, you must write the nodes in the order you wish them to appear

<indexterm><primary><literal>DCM_ATnode</literal> line writing</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Node line writing</primary></indexterm>

<para>The easiest way to write an <literal>@node</literal> line is to write <literal>@node</literal>
at the beginning of a line and then the name of the node, like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@node node-name
</programlisting>

<para>If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use the update node commands
provided by Texinfo mode to insert the names of the pointers; or you
can leave the pointers out of the Texinfo file and let <literal>makeinfo</literal>
insert node pointers into the Info file it creates.  (See <link linkend='texinfo-mode'>Texinfo Mode</link>, and <link linkend='makeinfo-pointer-creation'>makeinfo Pointer Creation</link>.)
</para>
<para>Alternatively, you can insert the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers yourself.  If you do this, you may find it helpful to use the
Texinfo mode keyboard command <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycap>n</keycap>.  This command inserts
<literal>@node</literal> and a comment line listing the names of the pointers in
their proper order.  The comment line helps you keep track of which
arguments are for which pointers.  This comment line is especially useful
if you are not familiar with Texinfo.
</para>
<para>The template for a fully-written-out node line with `Next', `Previous',
and `Up' pointers looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@node node-name, next, previous, up
</programlisting>

<para>If you wish, you can ignore <literal>@node</literal> lines altogether in your first
draft and then use the <literal>texinfo-insert-node-lines</literal> command to
create <literal>@node</literal> lines for you.  However, we do not recommend this
practice.  It is better to name the node itself at the same time that
you write a segment so you can easily make cross references.  A large
number of cross references are an especially important feature of a good
Info file.
</para>
<para>After you have inserted an <literal>@node</literal> line, you should immediately
write an @-command for the chapter or section and insert its name.
Next (and this is important!), put in several index entries.  Usually,
you will find at least two and often as many as four or five ways of
referring to the node in the index.  Use them all.  This will make it
much easier for people to find the node.

<para>Here are three suggestions:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Try to pick node names that are informative but short.
</para>
<para>In the Info file, the file name, node name, and pointer names are all
inserted on one line, which may run into the right edge of the window.
(This does not cause a problem with Info, but is ugly.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Try to pick node names that differ from each other near the beginnings
of their names.  This way, it is easy to use automatic name completion in
Info.
</para>
</listitem>

<para>By convention, node names are capitalized just as they would be for
section or chapter titles---initial and significant words are
capitalized; others are not.
</para></listitem>

<indexterm><primary>Node line requirements</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Restrictions on node names</primary></indexterm>
<para>Here are several requirements for <literal>@node</literal> lines:
</para>
<itemizedlist><indexterm><primary>Unique nodename requirement</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Node name must be unique</primary></indexterm>
<listitem>
<para>All the node names for a single Info file must be unique.
</para>
<para>Duplicates confuse the Info movement commands.  This means, for
example, that if you end every chapter with a summary, you must name
each summary node differently.  You cannot just call each one
``Summary''.  You may, however, duplicate the titles of chapters, sections,
and the like.  Thus you can end each chapter in a book with a section
called ``Summary'', so long as the node names for those sections are all
different.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A pointer name must be the name of a node.
</para>
<para>The node to which a pointer points may come before or after the

<indexterm><primary>Node name, should not contain DCM_AT-commands</primary></indexterm>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>@-commands used in node names generally confuse Info, so you
should avoid them.  This includes punctuation characters that are
escaped with a <literal>@</literal>, such as <literal>@</literal> and <literal>{</literal>.  For a few
rare cases when this is useful, Texinfo has limited support for using
@-commands in node names; see <link linkend='pointer-validation'>Pointer Validation</link>.
</para>

<para>Thus, the beginning of the section called <literal>@chapter</literal> looks like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@node  chapter, unnumbered &amp; appendix, makeinfo top, Structuring
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section @code{@@chapter}
@findex chapter

</programlisting>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<indexterm><primary>Parentheses in nodename</primary></indexterm>
<para>You cannot use parentheses in node names, because a node name such as
<literal>(foo)bar</literal> is interpreted by the Info readers as a node
<literal>bar</literal> in an Info file <filename>foo</filename>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<indexterm><primary>Apostrophe in nodename</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Colon in nodename</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>Characters, invalid in node name</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Invalid characters in node names</primary></indexterm>
<para>Unfortunately, you cannot use periods, commas, colons or apostrophes
within a node name; these confuse TeX or the Info formatters.
</para>

<para>For example, the following is a section title:
</para>
<programlisting>
@code{@@unnumberedsec}, @code{@@appendixsec}, @code{@@heading}
</programlisting>

<para>
The corresponding node name is:

<para>The first node of a Texinfo file is the <emphasis role='bold'>Top</emphasis> node, except in an
included file (see <link linkend='include-files'>Include Files</link>).  The Top node contains the main

<para>The Top node (which must be named <literal>top</literal> or <literal>Top</literal>) should have
as its `Up' node the name of a node in another file, where there is a
menu that leads to this file.  Specify the file name in parentheses.  If
the file is to be installed directly in the Info directory file, use
<literal>(dir)</literal> as the parent of the Top node; this is short for
<literal>(dir)top</literal>, and specifies the Top node in the <filename>dir</filename> file,
which contains the main menu for the Info system as a whole.  For
example, the <literal>@node Top</literal> line of this manual looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@node Top, Copying, , (dir)

utility to insert these pointers automatically.)

<para>Do not define the `Previous' node of the Top node to be <literal>(dir)</literal>, as
it causes confusing behavior for users: if you are in the Top node and

some other entry in the <filename>dir</filename> file, which has nothing to do with
what you were reading.

<para>A special sectioning command, <literal>@top</literal>, has been created for use
with the <literal>@node Top</literal> line.  The <literal>@top</literal> sectioning command tells
<literal>makeinfo</literal> that it marks the `Top' node in the file.  It provides
the information that <literal>makeinfo</literal> needs to insert node
pointers automatically.  Write the <literal>@top</literal> command at the
beginning of the line immediately following the <literal>@node Top</literal>
line.  Write the title on the remaining part of the same line as the
<literal>@top</literal> command.
</para>
<para>In Info, the <literal>@top</literal> sectioning command causes the title to appear on a
line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted underneath.
</para>
<para>In TeX and <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal>, the <literal>@top</literal>
sectioning command is merely a synonym for <literal>@unnumbered</literal>.
Neither of these formatters require an <literal>@top</literal> command, and do
nothing special with it.  You can use <literal>@chapter</literal> or
<literal>@unnumbered</literal> after the <literal>@node Top</literal> line when you use
these formatters.  Also, you can use <literal>@chapter</literal> or
<literal>@unnumbered</literal> when you use the Texinfo updating commands to
create or update pointers and menus.

<sect3 id='top-node-summary'><title id='top-node-summary-title'>The `Top' Node Summary</title>
<indexterm><primary><literal>Top</literal> node summary</primary></indexterm>

<para>You can help readers by writing a summary in the `Top' node, after the
<literal>@top</literal> line, before the main or master menu.  The summary should
briefly describe the document.  In Info, this summary will appear just
before the master menu.  In a printed manual, this summary will appear
on a page of its own.
</para>
<para>If you do not want the summary to appear on a page of its own in a
printed manual, you can enclose the whole of the `Top' node, including
the <literal>@node Top</literal> line and the <literal>@top</literal> sectioning command line
or other sectioning command line between <literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal>.  This prevents any of the text from appearing in the printed
output. (see <link linkend='conditionals'>Conditionally Visible Text</link>).  You can
repeat the brief description from the `Top' node within <literal>@iftex</literal>
&hellip; <literal>@end iftex</literal> at the beginning of the first chapter, for
those who read the printed manual.  This saves paper and may look
neater.
</para>
<para>You should write the version number of the program to which the manual
applies in the summary.  This helps the reader keep track of which
manual is for which version of the program.  If the manual changes more

include an edition number for the manual.  (The title page should also
contain this information: see <link linkend='titlepage'><literal>@titlepage</literal></link>.)

<para>The <literal>makeinfo</literal> program has a feature for automatically defining
node pointers for a hierarchically organized file.
</para>
<para>When you take advantage of this feature, you do not need to write the
`Next', `Previous', and `Up' pointers after the name of a node.
However, you must write a sectioning command, such as <literal>@chapter</literal>
or <literal>@section</literal>, on the line immediately following each truncated
<literal>@node</literal> line (except that comment lines may intervene).
</para>
<para>In addition, you must follow the `Top' <literal>@node</literal> line with a line
beginning with <literal>@top</literal> to mark the `Top' node in the
file.  See <link linkend='makeinfo-top'><literal>@top</literal></link>.
</para>
<para>Finally, you must write the name of each node (except for the `Top'
node) in a menu that is one or more hierarchical levels above the
node's hierarchical level.
</para>
<para>This node pointer insertion feature in <literal>makeinfo</literal> relieves you from
the need to update menus and pointers manually or with Texinfo mode
commands.  (See <link linkend='updating-nodes-and-menus'>Updating Nodes and Menus</link>.)
</para>
<para>In most cases, you will want to take advantage of this feature and not
redundantly specify node pointers.  However, Texinfo documents are not
required to be organized hierarchically or in fact contain sectioning
commands at all.  For example, if you never intend the document to be
printed.  In those cases, you will need to explicitly specify the pointers.

<indexterm><primary>Cross-reference targets, arbitrary</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Targets for cross-references, arbitrary</primary></indexterm>

<para>An <emphasis role='bold'>anchor</emphasis> is a position in your document, labeled so that
cross-references can refer to it, just as they can to nodes.  You create
an anchor with the <literal>@anchor</literal> command, and give the label as a
normal brace-delimited argument.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
This marks the @anchor{x-spot}spot.
&hellip;
@xref{x-spot,,the spot}.
</programlisting>

<para> produces:
</para>
<programlisting>
This marks the spot.
&hellip;
See [the spot], page 1.
</programlisting>

<para>As you can see, the <literal>@anchor</literal> command itself produces no output.
This example defines an anchor `x-spot' just before the word `spot'.
You can refer to it later with an <literal>@xref</literal> or other cross-reference
command, as shown.  See <link linkend='cross-references'>Cross References</link>, for details on the
cross-reference commands.
</para>
<para>It is best to put <literal>@anchor</literal> commands just before the position you
wish to refer to; that way, the reader's eye is led on to the correct
text when they jump to the anchor.  You can put the <literal>@anchor</literal>
command on a line by itself if that helps readability of the source.
Spaces are always ignored after <literal>@anchor</literal>.
</para>
<para>Anchor names and node names may not conflict.  Anchors and nodes are
given similar treatment in some ways; for example, the <literal>goto-node</literal>
command in standalone Info takes either an anchor name or a node name as
an argument.  (See (info-stnd).)

Info, you use menus to go to such nodes.  Menus have no effect in
printed manuals and do not appear in them.
</para>
<para>By convention, a menu is put at the end of a node since a reader who
uses the menu may not see text that follows it.  Furthermore, a node
that has a menu should not contain much text. If you have a lot of text
and a menu, move most of the text into a new subnode---all but a few
lines.  Otherwise, a reader with a terminal that displays only a few
lines may miss the menu and its associated text.  As a practical matter,
you should locate a menu within 20 lines of the beginning of the
node.

<sect1 id='menu-location'><title id='menu-location-title'>Menu Location</title>
<para>The short text before a menu may look awkward in a printed manual.  To
avoid this, you can write a menu near the beginning of its node and
follow the menu by an <literal>@node</literal> line, and then an <literal>@heading</literal>
line located within <literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal>.  This way,
the menu, <literal>@node</literal> line, and title appear only in the Info file,
not the printed document.

<para>For example, the preceding two paragraphs follow an Info-only menu,
<literal>@node</literal> line, and heading, and look like this:

</para>
<para>The <filename>dir</filename> file that contains the main menu for Info has menu
entries that list only file names.  These take you directly to the `Top'
nodes of each Info document.  (See <link linkend='installing-an-info-file'>Installing an Info File</link>.)
</para>

<para>For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

* Info: (info).         Documentation browsing system.
* Emacs: (emacs).       The extensible, self-documenting
                        text editor.

</programlisting>

<para>
(The <filename>dir</filename> top level directory for the Info system is an Info file,
not a Texinfo file, but a menu entry looks the same in both types of
file.)
</para>
<para>The GNU Emacs Texinfo mode menu updating commands only work with nodes
within the current buffer, so you cannot use them to create menus that
refer to other files.  You must write such menus by hand.

<para><emphasis role='bold'>Cross references</emphasis> are used to refer the reader to other parts of the
same or different Texinfo files.  In Texinfo, nodes and anchors are the
places to which cross references can refer.
</para>


</sect1>

<sect1 id='references'><title id='references-title'>References</title>
<para>Often, but not always, a printed document should be designed so that
it can be read sequentially.  People tire of flipping back and forth
to find information that should be presented to them as they need
it.
</para>
<para>However, in any document, some information will be too detailed for
the current context, or incidental to it; use cross references to
provide access to such information.  Also, an online help system or a
reference manual is not like a novel; few read such documents in
sequence from beginning to end.  Instead, people look up what they
need.  For this reason, such creations should contain many cross
references to help readers find other information that they may not
have read.
</para>
<para>In a printed manual, a cross reference results in a page reference,
unless it is to another manual altogether, in which case the cross
reference names that manual.
</para>
<para>In Info, a cross reference results in an entry that you can follow using
the Info <literal>f</literal> command.  (See (info)Some advanced Info commands.)
</para>
<para>The various cross reference commands use nodes (or anchors,
see <link linkend='anchor'><literal>@anchor</literal></link>) to define cross reference locations.
This is evident in Info, in which a cross reference takes you to the
specified location.  TeX also uses nodes to define cross reference
locations, but the action is less obvious.  When TeX generates a DVI
file, it records each node's page number and uses the page numbers in making
references.  Thus, if you are writing a manual that will only be
printed, and will not be used online, you must nonetheless write
<literal>@node</literal> lines to name the places to which you make cross
references.

<para>There are four different cross reference commands:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry><literal>@xref</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Used to start a sentence in the printed manual saying `See &hellip;'
or an Info cross-reference saying <literal>*Note name: node.</literal>.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@ref</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Used within or, more often, at the end of a sentence; same as
<literal>@xref</literal> for Info; produces just the reference in the printed
manual without a preceding `See'.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@pxref</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Used within parentheses to make a reference that suits both an Info
file and a printed book.  Starts with a lower case `see' within the
printed manual. (<literal>p</literal> is for `parenthesis'.)

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@inforef</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Used to make a reference to an Info file for which there is no printed
manual.
</entry>

<para>
(The <literal>@cite</literal> command is used to make references to books and

no node to which to point.   See <link linkend='cite'><literal>@cite</literal></link>.)

<para>A cross reference command requires only one argument, which is the
name of the node to which it refers.  But a cross reference command
may contain up to four additional arguments.  By using these
arguments, you can provide a cross reference name for Info, a topic
description or section title for the printed output, the name of a
different Info file, and the name of a different printed
manual.
</para>
<para>Here is a simple cross reference example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@xref{Node name}.
</programlisting>

<para>
which produces
</para>
<programlisting>
*Note Node name::.
</programlisting>

<para>
and
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section <literal>nnn</literal> [Node name], page <literal>ppp</literal>.
</para></blockquote>

<para>Here is an example of a full five-part cross reference:
</para>
<programlisting>

@xref{Node name, Cross Reference Name, Particular Topic,
info-file-name, A Printed Manual}, for details.

</programlisting>

<para>
which produces
</para>
<programlisting>
*Note Cross Reference Name: (info-file-name)Node name,
for details.
</programlisting>

<para>
in Info and
</para>
<blockquote><para>See section ``Particular Topic'' in <emphasis>A Printed Manual</emphasis>, for details.
</para></blockquote>
<para>
in a printed book.
</para>
<para>The five possible arguments for a cross reference are:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>The node or anchor name (required).  This is the location to which the
cross reference takes you.  In a printed document, the location of the
node provides the page reference only for references within the same
document.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The cross reference name for the Info reference, if it is to be different
from the node name.  If you include this argument, it becomes
the first part of the cross reference.  It is usually omitted.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A topic description or section name.  Often, this is the title of the
section.  This is used as the name of the reference in the printed
manual.  If omitted, the node name is used.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The name of the Info file in which the reference is located, if it is
different from the current file.  You need not include any <literal>.info</literal>
suffix on the file name, since Info readers try appending it
automatically.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The name of a printed manual from a different Texinfo file.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The template for a full five argument cross reference looks like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@xref{node-name, cross-reference-name, title-or-topic,
info-file-name, printed-manual-title}.

</programlisting>

<para>Cross references with one, two, three, four, and five arguments are
described separately following the description of <literal>@xref</literal>.
</para>
<para>Write a node name in a cross reference in exactly the same way as in
the <literal>@node</literal> line, including the same capitalization; otherwise, the
formatters may not find the reference.
</para>
<para>You can write cross reference commands within a paragraph, but note
how Info and TeX format the output of each of the various commands:
write <literal>@xref</literal> at the beginning of a sentence; write
<literal>@pxref</literal> only within parentheses, and so on.
</para>
<!--   node-name,  next,  previous,  up -->

<indexterm><primary>References using <literal>DCM_ATxref</literal></primary></indexterm>

<para>The <literal>@xref</literal> command generates a cross reference for the
beginning of a sentence.  The Info formatting commands convert it into
an Info cross reference, which the Info <literal>f</literal> command can use to
bring you directly to another node.  The TeX typesetting commands
convert it into a page reference, or a reference to another book or
manual.
</para>


<sect3 id='reference-syntax'><title id='reference-syntax-title'>Reference Syntax</title>
<para>Most often, an Info cross reference looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
*Note node-name::.
</programlisting>

<para>
or like this
</para>
<programlisting>
*Note cross-reference-name: node-name.
</programlisting>

<para>
In TeX, a cross reference looks like this:
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section <literal>section-number</literal> [<literal>node-name</literal>], page <literal>page</literal>.
</para></blockquote>
<para>
or like this
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section <literal>section-number</literal> [<literal>title-or-topic</literal>], page <literal>page</literal>.
</para></blockquote>
<para>The <literal>@xref</literal> command does not generate a period or comma to end
the cross reference in either the Info file or the printed output.
You must write that period or comma yourself; otherwise, Info will not
recognize the end of the reference.  (The <literal>@pxref</literal> command works
differently.  See <link linkend='pxref'><literal>@pxref</literal></link>.)
</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Please note:</emphasis> A period or comma <emphasis role='bold'>must</emphasis> follow the closing
brace of an <literal>@xref</literal>.  It is required to terminate the cross
reference.  This period or comma will appear in the output, both in
the Info file and in the printed manual.
</para></blockquote>
<para><literal>@xref</literal> must refer to an Info node by name.  Use <literal>@node</literal>
to define the node (see <link linkend='writing-a-node'>Writing a Node</link>).
</para>
<para><literal>@xref</literal> is followed by several arguments inside braces, separated by
commas.  Whitespace before and after these commas is ignored.
</para>
<para>A cross reference requires only the name of a node; but it may contain
up to four additional arguments.  Each of these variations produces a
cross reference that looks somewhat different.
</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Please note:</emphasis> Commas separate arguments in a cross reference;
avoid including them in the title or other part lest the formatters
mistake them for separators.
</para></blockquote>
</sect3>

<sect3 id='one-argument'><title id='one-argument-title'><literal>@xref</literal> with One Argument</title>

<para>The simplest form of <literal>@xref</literal> takes one argument, the name of
another node in the same Info file.    The Info formatters produce
output that the Info readers can use to jump to the reference; TeX
produces output that specifies the page and section number for you.
</para>

<para>
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
@xref{Tropical Storms}.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<programlisting>
*Note Tropical Storms::.
</programlisting>

<para>
and
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24.
</para></blockquote>
<para>
(Note that in the preceding example the closing brace is followed by a
period.)
</para>
<para>You can write a clause after the cross reference, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@xref{Tropical Storms}, for more info.
</programlisting>

<para>
which produces
</para>
<programlisting>

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id='two-arguments'><title id='two-arguments-title'><literal>@xref</literal> with Two Arguments</title>

<para>With two arguments, the second is used as the name of the Info cross
reference, while the first is still the name of the node to which the
cross reference points.
</para>

<para>
The template is like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@xref{node-name, cross-reference-name}.
</programlisting>


<para>
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
@xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning}.

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id='three-arguments'><title id='three-arguments-title'><literal>@xref</literal> with Three Arguments</title>

<para>A third argument replaces the node name in the TeX output.  The third
argument should be the name of the section in the printed output, or
else state the topic discussed by that section.  Often, you will want to
use initial upper case letters so it will be easier to read when the
reference is printed.  Use a third argument when the node name is
unsuitable because of syntax or meaning.
</para>
<para>Remember to avoid placing a comma within the title or topic section of
a cross reference, or within any other section.  The formatters divide
cross references into arguments according to the commas; a comma
within a title or other section will divide it into two arguments.  In
a reference, you need to write a title such as ``Clouds, Mist, and
Fog'' without the commas.
</para>
<para>Also, remember to write a comma or period after the closing brace of an
<literal>@xref</literal> to terminate the cross reference.  In the following
examples, a clause follows a terminating comma.
</para>


<para>
The template is like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@xref{node-name, cross-reference-name, title-or-topic}.

</programlisting>


<para>
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>

@xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning, Thunder and Lightning},

*Note Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.
</programlisting>

<para>
and
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.
</para></blockquote>
<para>If a third argument is given and the second one is empty, then the
third argument serves both.  (Note how two commas, side by side, mark
the empty second argument.)
</para>
<programlisting>

@xref{Electrical Effects, , Thunder and Lightning},
for details.

</programlisting>

<para>
produces

*Note Thunder and Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.
</programlisting>

<para>
and
</para>
<blockquote><para>See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.
</para></blockquote>
<para>As a practical matter, it is often best to write cross references with
just the first argument if the node name and the section title are the
same, and with the first and third arguments if the node name and title
are different.
</para>
<para>Here are several examples from <citetitle>The GNU Awk User's Guide</citetitle>:

<para>Remember that a comma or period must follow the closing brace of an
<literal>@xref</literal> command to terminate the cross reference.  In the

<para>
The title of the printed manual is typeset in italics; and the
reference lacks a page number since TeX cannot know to which page a
reference refers when that reference is to another manual.
</para>
<para>Often, you will leave out the second argument when you use the long
version of <literal>@xref</literal>.  In this case, the third argument, the topic
description, will be used as the cross reference name in Info.

<para>On rare occasions, you may want to refer to another Info file that

<para>In a cross reference, you must always name a node.  This means that in
order to refer to a whole manual, you must identify the `Top' node by
writing it as the first argument to the <literal>@xref</literal> command.  (This
is different from the way you write a menu entry; see <link linkend='other-info-files'>Referring to Other Info Files</link>.)  At the same time, to
provide a meaningful section topic or title in the printed cross
reference (instead of the word `Top'), you must write an appropriate
entry for the third argument to the <literal>@xref</literal> command.

<para>The parenthetical reference command, <literal>@pxref</literal>, is nearly the
same as <literal>@xref</literal>, but you use it <emphasis>only</emphasis> inside parentheses
and you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> type a comma or period after the command's
closing brace.  The command differs from <literal>@xref</literal> in two
ways:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>TeX typesets the reference for the printed manual with a lower case
`see' rather than an upper case `See'.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The Info formatting commands automatically end the reference with a
closing colon or period.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Because one type of formatting automatically inserts closing
punctuation and the other does not, you should use <literal>@pxref</literal>
<emphasis>only</emphasis> inside parentheses as part of another sentence.  Also, you
yourself should not insert punctuation after the reference, as you do
with <literal>@xref</literal>.
</para>
<para><literal>@pxref</literal> is designed so that the output looks right and works
right between parentheses both in printed output and in an Info file.
In a printed manual, a closing comma or period should not follow a
cross reference within parentheses; such punctuation is wrong.  But in
an Info file, suitable closing punctuation must follow the cross
reference so Info can recognize its end.  <literal>@pxref</literal> spares you
the need to use complicated methods to put a terminator into one form
of the output and not the other.
</para>
<para>
With one argument, a parenthetical cross reference looks like
this:
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Flooding</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
&hellip; storms cause flooding (@pxref{Hurricanes}) &hellip;

there are no printed manuals.  Even in a printed manual,
<literal>@inforef</literal> generates a reference directing the user to look in
an Info file.
</para>
<para>The command takes either two or three arguments, in the following
order:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>The node name.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The cross reference name (optional).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The Info file name.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Separate the arguments with commas, as with <literal>@xref</literal>.  Also, you
must terminate the reference with a comma or period after the
<literal>}</literal>, as you do with <literal>@xref</literal>.
</para>
<para>
The template is:
</para>
<programlisting>
@inforef{node-name, cross-reference-name, info-file-name},
</programlisting>


<para>
Thus,
</para>
<programlisting>

@inforef{Expert, Advanced Info commands, info},

</programlisting>


<para>
produces

<para><literal>@uref</literal> produces a reference to a uniform resource locator (url).
It takes one mandatory argument, the url, and two optional arguments
which control the text that is displayed.  In HTML output, <literal>@uref</literal>
produces a link you can follow.
</para>
<para>The second argument, if specified, is the text to display (the default
is the url itself); in Info and DVI output, but not in HTML output, the
url is also output.
</para>

<para>The third argument, on the other hand, if specified is also the text to
display, but the url is <emphasis>not</emphasis> output in any format.  This is useful
when the text is already sufficiently referential, as in a man page.  If
the third argument is given, the second argument is ignored.

<para>In Texinfo, you can mark words and phrases in a variety of ways.
The Texinfo formatters use this information to determine how to
highlight the text.
You can specify, for example, whether a word or phrase is a
defining occurrence, a metasyntactic variable, or a symbol used in a
program.  Also, you can emphasize text, in several different ways.
</para>


<sect2 id='indicating'><title id='indicating-title'>Indicating Definitions, Commands, etc.</title>
<indexterm><primary>Highlighting text</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Indicating commands, definitions, etc.</primary></indexterm>

<para>Texinfo has commands for indicating just what kind of object a piece of
text refers to.  For example, metasyntactic variables are marked by
<literal>@var</literal>, and code by <literal>@code</literal>.  Since the pieces of text are
labelled by commands that tell what kind of object they are, it is easy
to change the way the Texinfo formatters prepare such text.  (Texinfo is
an <emphasis>intentional</emphasis> formatting language rather than a <emphasis>typesetting</emphasis>
formatting language.)
</para>
<para>For example, in a printed manual,
code is usually illustrated in a typewriter font;
<literal>@code</literal> tells TeX to typeset this text in this font.  But it
would be easy to change the way TeX highlights code to use another
font, and this change would not affect how keystroke examples are
highlighted.  If straight typesetting commands were used in the body
of the file and you wanted to make a change, you would need to check
every single occurrence to make sure that you were changing code and
not something else that should not be changed.
</para>



<sect3 id='useful-highlighting'><title id='useful-highlighting-title'>Useful Highlighting</title>
<para>The highlighting commands can be used to extract useful information
from the file, such as lists of functions or file names.  It is
possible, for example, to write a program in Emacs Lisp (or a keyboard
macro) to insert an index entry after every paragraph that contains
words or phrases marked by a specified command.  You could do this to
construct an index of functions if you had not already made the
entries.

<indexterm><primary>code</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>Syntactic tokens, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<para>Use the <literal>@code</literal> command to indicate text that is a piece of a
program and which consists of entire syntactic tokens.  Enclose the
text in braces.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Expressions in a program, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Keywords, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Reserved words, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<para>Thus, you should use <literal>@code</literal> for an expression in a program, for
the name of a variable or function used in a program, or for a
keyword in a programming language.
</para>
<para>Use <literal>@code</literal> for command names in languages that resemble
programming languages, such as Texinfo.  For example, <literal>@code</literal> and
<literal>@samp</literal> are produced by writing <literal>@code{@@code}</literal> and
<literal>@code{@@samp}</literal> in the Texinfo source, respectively.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Case, not altering in <literal>DCM_ATcode</literal></primary></indexterm>
<para>It is incorrect to alter the case of a word inside an <literal>@code</literal>
command when it appears at the beginning of a sentence.  Most computer
languages are case sensitive.  In C, for example, <literal>Printf</literal> is
different from the identifier <literal>printf</literal>, and most likely is a
misspelling of it.  Even in languages which are not case sensitive, it
is confusing to a human reader to see identifiers spelled in different
ways.  Pick one spelling and always use that.  If you do not want to
start a sentence with a command name written all in lower case, you
should rearrange the sentence.
</para>
<para>In the printed manual, <literal>@code</literal> causes TeX to typeset the
argument in a typewriter face.  In the Info file, it causes the Info
formatting commands to use single quotation marks around the text.
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
The function returns @code{nil}.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces this in the printed manual:
</para>
<blockquote><para>The function returns <literal>nil</literal>.
</para></blockquote>

<para>Here are some cases for which it is preferable not to use <literal>@code</literal>:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>For shell command names such as <command>ls</command> (use <literal>@command</literal>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>For shell options such as <literal>-c</literal> when such options stand alone (use
<literal>@option</literal>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Also, an entire shell command often looks better if written using
<literal>@samp</literal> rather than <literal>@code</literal>.  In this case, the rule is to
choose the more pleasing format.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>For environment variable such as <envar>TEXINPUTS</envar> (use <literal>@env</literal>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>For a string of characters shorter than a syntactic token.  For example,
if you are writing about <literal>goto-ch</literal>, which is just a part of the
name for the <literal>goto-char</literal> Emacs Lisp function, you should use
<literal>@samp</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In general, when writing about the characters used in a token; for
example, do not use <literal>@code</literal> when you are explaining what letters
or printable symbols can be used in the names of functions.  (Use
<literal>@samp</literal>.)  Also, you should not use <literal>@code</literal> to mark text
that is considered input to programs unless the input is written in a
language that is like a programming language.  For example, you should
not use <literal>@code</literal> for the keystroke commands of GNU Emacs (use
<literal>@kbd</literal> instead) although you may use <literal>@code</literal> for the names
of the Emacs Lisp functions that the keystroke commands invoke.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Since <literal>@command</literal>, <literal>@option</literal>, and <literal>@env</literal> were
introduced relatively recently, it is acceptable to use <literal>@code</literal> or
<literal>@samp</literal> for command names, options, and environment variables.
The new commands allow you to express the markup more precisely, but
there is no real harm in using the older commands, and of course the
long-standing manuals do so.

<indexterm><primary>user input</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>slanted typewriter font, for <literal>DCM_ATkbd</literal></primary></indexterm>
<para>The <literal>@kbd</literal> command has the same effect as <literal>@code</literal> in Info,
but by default produces a different font (slanted typewriter instead of
normal typewriter) in the printed manual, so users can distinguish the
characters they are supposed to type from those the computer outputs.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>kbdinputstyle</primary></indexterm>
<para>Since the usage of <literal>@kbd</literal> varies from manual to manual, you can
control the font switching with the <literal>@kbdinputstyle</literal> command.
This command has no effect on Info output.  Write this command at the
beginning of a line with a single word as an argument, one of the
following:
</para><informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>

<para>You can embed another @-command inside the braces of an <literal>@kbd</literal>
command.  Here, for example, is the way to describe a command that
would be described more verbosely as ``press an <literal>r</literal> and then
press the <keycap>RET</keycap> key'':
</para>
<programlisting>
@kbd{r @key{RET}}
</programlisting>

<para>
This produces: <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>r</keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo>
</para>
<para>You also use the <literal>@kbd</literal> command if you are spelling out the letters
you type; for example:
</para>
<programlisting>
To give the @code{logout} command,
type the characters @kbd{l o g o u t @key{RET}}.
</programlisting>

<para>
This produces:
</para>
<blockquote><para>To give the <literal>logout</literal> command,
type the characters <keycap>l</keycap><keycap>o</keycap><keycap>g</keycap><keycap>o</keycap><keycap>u</keycap><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>t</keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo>.
</para></blockquote>
<para>(Also, this example shows that you can add spaces for clarity.  If you
really want to mention a space character as one of the characters of
input, write <keycap>@key{SPC}</keycap> for it.)

<para>Use the <literal>@key</literal> command for the conventional name for a key on a

<para>You can use the <literal>@key</literal> command within the argument of an
<literal>@kbd</literal> command when the sequence of characters to be typed
includes one or more keys that are described by name.
</para>

<para>For example, to produce <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap><keycap>ESC</keycap></keycombo> you would type:

<indexterm><primary>META key</primary></indexterm>
<para>There are subtleties to handling words like `meta' or `ctrl' that are
names of modifier keys.  When mentioning a character in which the
modifier key is used, such as <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>a</keycap></keycombo>, use the <literal>@kbd</literal> command
alone; do not use the <literal>@key</literal> command; but when you are referring
to the modifier key in isolation, use the <literal>@key</literal> command.  For
example, write <literal>@kbd{Meta-a}</literal> to produce <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>Meta</keycap><keycap>a</keycap></keycombo> and
<literal>@key{META}</literal> to produce <keycap>META</keycap>.

<para>Use the <literal>@samp</literal> command to indicate text that is a literal example
or `sample' of a sequence of characters in a file, string, pattern, etc.
Enclose the text in braces.  The argument appears within single
quotation marks in both the Info file and the printed manual; in
addition, it is printed in a fixed-width font.

use the regexp @samp{foo$}.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<blockquote><para>To match <literal>foo</literal> at the end of the line, use the regexp
<literal>foo$</literal>.
</para></blockquote>
<para>Any time you are referring to single characters, you should use
<literal>@samp</literal> unless <literal>@kbd</literal> or <literal>@key</literal> is more appropriate.
Also, you may use <literal>@samp</literal> for entire statements in C and for entire
shell commands---in this case, <literal>@samp</literal> often looks better than
<literal>@code</literal>.  Basically, <literal>@samp</literal> is a catchall for whatever is
not covered by <literal>@code</literal>, <literal>@kbd</literal>, or <literal>@key</literal>.
</para>
<para>Only include punctuation marks within braces if they are part of the
string you are specifying.  Write punctuation marks outside the braces
if those punctuation marks are part of the English text that surrounds
the string.  In the following sentence, for example, the commas and
period are outside of the braces:

<indexterm><primary>Delimiter character, for verbatim </primary></indexterm>
<para>Use the <literal>@verb</literal> command to print a verbatim sequence of

</para>
<para>Like LaTeX's <literal>\verb</literal> command, the verbatim text can be quoted using
any unique delimiter character.  Enclose the verbatim text, including the

<indexterm><primary>var</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@var</literal> command to indicate metasyntactic variables.  A
<emphasis role='bold'>metasyntactic variable</emphasis> is something that stands for another piece of
text.  For example, you should use a metasyntactic variable in the
documentation of a function to describe the arguments that are passed
to that function.
</para>
<para>Do not use <literal>@var</literal> for the names of particular variables in
programming languages.  These are specific names from a program, so
<literal>@code</literal> is correct for them (see <link linkend='code'><literal>@code</literal>{<literal>sample-code</literal>}</link>).  For example, the
Emacs Lisp variable <literal>texinfo-tex-command</literal> is not a metasyntactic
variable; it is properly formatted using <literal>@code</literal>.
</para>
<para>Do not use <literal>@var</literal> for environment variables either; <literal>@env</literal>
is correct for them (see the next section).
</para>
<para>The effect of <literal>@var</literal> in the Info file is to change the case of the
argument to all upper case.  In the printed manual and HTML output, the
argument is printed in slanted type.  
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
To delete file @var{filename},
type @samp{rm @var{filename}}.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<blockquote><para>To delete file <literal>filename</literal>, type <literal>rm filename</literal>.

<para>Write a metasyntactic variable all in lower case without spaces, and

the illustration of how to begin a Texinfo manual looks like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@@setfilename @var{info-file-name}
@@settitle @var{name-of-manual}

</programlisting>

<para>
This produces:
</para>
<programlisting>

@setfilename info-file-name
@settitle name-of-manual

</programlisting>

<para>In some documentation styles, metasyntactic variables are shown with
angle brackets, for example:
</para>
<programlisting>
&hellip;, type rm &lt;filename&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>
However, that is not the style that Texinfo uses.  (You can, of
course, modify the sources to <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> and the Info formatting commands
to output the <literal>&lt;&hellip;&gt;</literal> format if you wish.)
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='env'><title id='env-title'><literal>@env</literal>{<literal>environment-variable</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>env</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@env</literal> command to indicate environment variables, as used
by many operating systems, including GNU.  Do not use it for
metasyntactic variables; use <literal>@var</literal> instead (see the previous
section).
</para>
<para><literal>@env</literal> is equivalent to <literal>@code</literal> in its effects.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
The @env{PATH} environment variable &hellip;
</programlisting>
<para> produces
</para><blockquote><para>The <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable &hellip;
</para></blockquote>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='file'><title id='file-title'><literal>@file</literal>{<literal>file-name</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>file</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@file</literal> command to indicate text that is the name of a
file, buffer, or directory, or is the name of a node in Info.  You can
also use the command for file name suffixes.  Do not use <literal>@file</literal>
for symbols in a programming language; use <literal>@code</literal>.
</para>
<para>Currently, <literal>@file</literal> is equivalent to <literal>@samp</literal> in its effects.
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
The @file{.el} files are in
the @file{/usr/local/emacs/lisp} directory.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<blockquote><para>The <filename>.el</filename> files are in
the <filename>/usr/local/emacs/lisp</filename> directory.
</para></blockquote>

<indexterm><primary>command</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Command names, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Program names, indicating</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@command</literal> command to indicate command names, such as
<command>ls</command> or <command>cc</command>.
</para>
<para><literal>@command</literal> is equivalent to <literal>@code</literal> in its effects.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
The command @command{ls} lists directory contents.
</programlisting>
<para> produces
</para><blockquote><para>The command <command>ls</command> lists directory contents.
</para></blockquote>
<para>You should write the name of a program in the ordinary text font, rather
than using <literal>@command</literal>, if you regard it as a new English word,
such as `Emacs' or `Bison'.
</para>
<para>When writing an entire shell command invocation, as in <literal>ls -l</literal>,
you should use either <literal>@samp</literal> or <literal>@code</literal> at your discretion.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='option'><title id='option-title'><literal>@option</literal>{<literal>option-name</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>option</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@option</literal> command to indicate a command-line option; for
example, <option>-l</option> or <option>--version</option> or
<option>--output=filename</option>.
</para>
<para><literal>@option</literal> is equivalent to <literal>@samp</literal> in its effects.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
The option @option{-l} produces a long listing.
</programlisting>
<para> produces
</para><blockquote><para>The option <option>-l</option> produces a long listing.
</para></blockquote>
<para>In tables, putting options inside <literal>@code</literal> produces a
more pleasing effect.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='dfn'><title id='dfn-title'><literal>@dfn</literal>{<literal>term</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>dfn</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@dfn</literal> command to identify the introductory or defining
use of a technical term.  Use the command only in passages whose
purpose is to introduce a term which will be used again or which the
reader ought to know.  Mere passing mention of a term for the first
time does not deserve <literal>@dfn</literal>.  The command generates italics in
the printed manual, and double quotation marks in the Info file.  For
example:
</para>
<programlisting>
Getting rid of a file is called @dfn{deleting} it.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<blockquote><para>Getting rid of a file is called <emphasis role='bold'>deleting</emphasis> it.
</para></blockquote>
<para>As a general rule, a sentence containing the defining occurrence of a
term should be a definition of the term.  The sentence does not need
to say explicitly that it is a definition, but it should contain the
information of a definition---it should make the meaning clear.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id='cite'><title id='cite-title'><literal>@cite</literal>{<literal>reference</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>cite</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@cite</literal> command for the name of a book that lacks a
companion Info file.  The command produces italics in the printed
manual, and quotation marks in the Info file.
</para>
<para>If a book is written in Texinfo, it is better to use a cross reference
command since a reader can easily follow such a reference in Info.
See <link linkend='xref'><literal>@xref</literal></link>.

<indexterm><primary>F.B.I., as acronym</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Abbreviations, tagging</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Acronyms, tagging</primary></indexterm>
<para>Use the <literal>@acronym</literal> command for abbreviations written in all
capital letters, such as `<abbrev>NASA</abbrev>'.  The abbreviation is given as
the single argument in braces, as in <literal>@acronym{NASA}</literal>.  As
a matter of style, or for particular abbreviations, you may prefer to
use periods, as in <literal>@acronym{F.B.I.}</literal>.
</para>
<para>In TeX and HTML, the argument is printed in a slightly smaller font
size.  In Info or plain text output, this command changes nothing.

<indexterm><primary>url</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Uniform resource locator, indicating</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>URL, indicating</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@url</literal> command to indicate a uniform resource locator on
the World Wide Web.  This is analogous to <literal>@file</literal>, <literal>@var</literal>,
etc., and is purely for markup purposes.  It does not produce a link you
can follow in HTML output (use the <literal>@uref</literal> command for that,
see <link linkend='uref'><literal>@uref</literal></link>).  It is useful for url's which do
not actually exist.  For example:
</para>
<!--  Two lines because one is too long for smallbook format. -->

<programlisting>
For example, the url might be @url{http://example.org/path}.
</programlisting>

<para> which produces:
</para>
<literallayout>
For example, the url might be <ulink url='http://example.org/path'>http://example.org/path</ulink>.

<sect3 id='email'><title id='email-title'><literal>@email</literal>{<literal>email-address</literal>[, <literal>displayed-text</literal>]}</title>
<indexterm><primary>email</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@email</literal> command to indicate an electronic mail address.
It takes one mandatory argument, the address, and one optional argument, the
text to display (the default is the address itself).
</para>
<indexterm><primary>mailto link</primary></indexterm>
<para>In Info and TeX, the address is shown in angle brackets, preceded by
the text to display if any.  In HTML output, <literal>@email</literal> produces a
<literal>mailto</literal> link that usually brings up a mail composition window.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
Send bug reports to @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org},
suggestions to the @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org, same place}.
</programlisting>
<para> produces
<literallayout>
Send bug reports to <email>bug-texinfo@gnu.org</email>,

<sect2 id='emphasis'><title id='emphasis-title'>Emphasizing Text</title>
<indexterm><primary>Emphasizing text</primary></indexterm>

<para>Usually, Texinfo changes the font to mark words in the text according to
what category the words belong to; an example is the <literal>@code</literal> command.
Most often, this is the best way to mark words.
However, sometimes you will want to emphasize text without indicating a
category.  Texinfo has two commands to do this.  Also, Texinfo has
several commands that specify the font in which TeX will typeset
text.  These commands have no effect on Info and only one of them,
the <literal>@r</literal> command, has any regular use.
</para>

<sect3 id='emph-and-strong'><title id='emph-and-strong-title'><literal>@emph</literal>{<literal>text</literal>} and <literal>@strong</literal>{<literal>text</literal>}</title>
<indexterm><primary>Emphasizing text, font for</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>emph</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>strong</primary></indexterm>

<para>The <literal>@emph</literal> and <literal>@strong</literal> commands are for emphasis;
<literal>@strong</literal> is stronger.  In printed output, <literal>@emph</literal> produces
<emphasis>italics</emphasis> and <literal>@strong</literal> produces <emphasis role='bold'>bold</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>

@quotation
@strong{Caution:} @samp{rm * .[^.]*} removes @emph{all}
files in the directory.
@end quotation

</programlisting>


<programlisting>
     *Caution*: `rm * .[^.]*' removes _all_
     files in the directory.
</programlisting>

<para>The <literal>@strong</literal> command is seldom used except to mark what is, in
effect, a typographical element, such as the word `Caution' in the
preceding example.
</para>
<para>In the Info output, <literal>@emph</literal> surrounds the text with underscores
(<literal>_</literal>), and <literal>@strong</literal> puts asterisks around the text.
</para>
<blockquote><para><emphasis role='bold'>Caution:</emphasis> Do not use <literal>@strong</literal> with the word <literal>Note</literal>;
Info will mistake the combination for a cross reference.  Use a phrase
such as <emphasis role='bold'>Please note</emphasis> or <emphasis role='bold'>Caution</emphasis> instead.
</para></blockquote>

<indexterm><primary>Small caps font</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>sc (small caps font)</primary></indexterm>

<para>Use the <literal>@sc</literal> command to set text in the printed and the HTML
output in a small caps font and set text in the Info file in upper
case letters.  Write the text you want to be in small caps (where
possible) between braces in lower case, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
The @sc{acm} and @sc{ieee} are technical societies.
</programlisting>

<para>
This produces:
</para>
<literallayout>
The acm and ieee are technical societies.
</literallayout>

<para>TeX typesets the small caps font in a manner that prevents the
letters from `jumping out at you on the page'.  This makes small caps
text easier to read than text in all upper case---but it's usually
better to use regular mixed case anyway.  The Info formatting commands
set all small caps text in upper case.  In HTML, the text is upper-cased
and a smaller font is used to render it.
</para>
<para>If the text between the braces of an <literal>@sc</literal> command is uppercase,
TeX typesets in FULL-SIZE CAPITALS.  Use full-size capitals
sparingly, if ever, and since it's redundant to mark all-uppercase text
with <literal>@sc</literal>, <command>makeinfo</command> warns about such usage.
</para>
<para>You may also use the small caps font for a jargon word such as
ato (a nasa word meaning `abort to orbit').
</para>
<para>There are subtleties to using the small caps font with a jargon word
such as cdr, a word used in Lisp programming.  In this case, you
should use the small caps font when the word refers to the second and
subsequent elements of a list (the cdr of the list), but you
should use <literal>@code</literal> when the word refers to the Lisp function of
the same spelling.

<indexterm><primary>r (Roman font)</primary></indexterm>

<para>Texinfo provides four font commands that specify font changes in the
printed manual but have no effect in the Info file.  <literal>@i</literal>
requests <emphasis>italic</emphasis> font (in some versions of TeX, a slanted font
is used), <literal>@b</literal> requests <emphasis role='bold'>bold</emphasis> face, <literal>@t</literal> requests the
<programlisting>fixed-width</programlisting>, typewriter-style font used by <literal>@code</literal>, and <literal>@r</literal> requests a
roman font, which is the usual font in which text is printed.  All
four commands apply to an argument that follows, surrounded by
braces.
</para>
<para>Only the <literal>@r</literal> command has much use: in example programs, you
can use the <literal>@r</literal> command to convert code comments from the
fixed-width font to a roman font.  This looks better in printed
output.
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>

@lisp
(+ 2 2)    ; @r{Add two plus two.}
@end lisp

</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<programlisting>
(+ 2 2)    ; @r{Add two plus two.}
</programlisting>

<para>If possible, you should avoid using the other three font commands.  If
you need to use one, it probably indicates a gap in the Texinfo
language.

<para>Quotations and examples are blocks of text consisting of one or more

<para>In Texinfo, you always begin a quotation or example by writing an

<para>In addition to the regular <literal>@example</literal> and <literal>@lisp</literal> commands,
Texinfo has ``small'' example-style commands.  These are
<literal>@smalldisplay</literal>, <literal>@smallexample</literal>, <literal>@smallformat</literal>, and
<literal>@smalllisp</literal>.
</para>
<para>In TeX, the <literal>@small&hellip;</literal> commands typeset text in a smaller
font than the non-small example commands.  Consequently, many examples
containing long lines fit on a page without needing to be shortened.
</para>
<para>In Info, the <literal>@small&hellip;</literal> commands are equivalent to their
non-small companion commands.
</para>
<para>Mark the end of an <literal>@small&hellip;</literal> block with a corresponding
<literal>@end small&hellip;</literal>.  For example, pair <literal>@smallexample</literal> with
<literal>@end smallexample</literal>.
</para>

<para>The <literal>@small&hellip;</literal> commands make it easier to prepare manuals
without forcing you to edit examples by hand to fit them onto narrower
pages.
</para>
<para>As a general rule, a printed document looks better if you use only one
of (for example) <literal>@example</literal> or in <literal>@smallexample</literal>
consistently within a chapter.  Only occasionally should you mix the two
formats.

<para>The <literal>@display</literal> command begins a kind of example.  It is like the
<literal>@example</literal> command
except that, in
a printed manual, <literal>@display</literal> does not select the fixed-width
font.  In fact, it does not specify the font at all, so that the text
appears in the same font it would have appeared in without the
<literal>@display</literal> command.

and an @end display command.  The @display command
indents the text, but does not fill it.
</literallayout>

<para>Texinfo also provides a command <literal>@smalldisplay</literal>, which is like
<literal>@display</literal> but uses a smaller font in <literal>@smallbook</literal> format.

<para>The <literal>@exdent</literal> command removes any indentation a line might have.
The command is written at the beginning of a line and applies only to
the text that follows the command that is on the same line.  Do not use
braces around the text.  In a printed manual, the text on an
<literal>@exdent</literal> line is printed in the roman font.
</para>
<para><literal>@exdent</literal> is usually used within examples.  Thus,
</para>
<programlisting>

@example
This line follows an @@example command.
@exdent This line is exdented.
This line follows the exdented line.
The @@end example comes on the next line.

<para>An example or other inclusion can break a paragraph into segments.
Ordinarily, the formatters indent text that follows an example as a new

text.
</para>

<para>For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@example

<para>Texinfo has several ways of making lists and tables.  Lists can be
bulleted or numbered; two-column tables can highlight the items in
the first column; multi-column tables are also supported.
</para>


</sect1>

<sect1 id='introducing-lists'><title id='introducing-lists-title'>Introducing Lists</title>
<para>Texinfo automatically indents the text in lists or tables, and numbers
an enumerated list.  This last feature is useful if you modify the
list, since you do not need to renumber it yourself.
</para>
<para>Numbered lists and tables begin with the appropriate @-command at the
beginning of a line, and end with the corresponding <literal>@end</literal>
command on a line by itself.  The table and itemized-list commands
also require that you write formatting information on the same line as
the beginning @-command.
</para>
<para>Begin an enumerated list, for example, with an <literal>@enumerate</literal>
command and end the list with an <literal>@end enumerate</literal> command.
Begin an itemized list with an <literal>@itemize</literal> command, followed on
the same line by a formatting command such as <literal>@bullet</literal>, and end
the list with an <literal>@end itemize</literal> command.

paragraphs, with a bullet or other mark inside the left margin
at the beginning of each paragraph for which such a mark is desired.
</para>
<indexterm><primary><literal>DCM_ATw</literal>, for blank items</primary></indexterm>
<para>Begin an itemized list by writing <literal>@itemize</literal> at the beginning of
a line.  Follow the command, on the same line, with a character or a
Texinfo command that generates a mark.  Usually, you will write
<literal>@bullet</literal> after <literal>@itemize</literal>, but you can use
<literal>@minus</literal>, or any command or character that results in a single
character in the Info file.  If you don't want any mark at all, use
<literal>@w</literal>.  (When you write the mark command such as
<literal>@bullet</literal> after an <literal>@itemize</literal> command, you may omit the
<literal>{}</literal>.)  If you don't specify a mark command, the default is
<literal>@bullet</literal>.
</para>
<para>Write the text of the indented paragraphs themselves after the
<literal>@itemize</literal>, up to another line that says <literal>@end itemize</literal>.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>item</primary></indexterm>
<para>Before each paragraph for which a mark in the margin is desired, write a
line that says just <literal>@item</literal>.  It is ok to have text following the
<literal>@item</literal>.
</para>
<para>Usually, you should put a blank line before an <literal>@item</literal>.  This
puts a blank line in the Info file. (TeX inserts the proper
interline whitespace in either case.)  Except when the entries are
very brief, these blank lines make the list look better.
</para>
<para>Here is an example of the use of <literal>@itemize</literal>, followed by the
output it produces.  <literal>@bullet</literal> produces an <literal>*</literal> in Info and a
round dot in TeX.
</para>
<programlisting>

@itemize @bullet
@item
Some text for foo.

@item
Some text

@end itemize

<para><literal>@enumerate</literal> is like <literal>@itemize</literal> (see <link linkend='itemize'><literal>@itemize</literal></link>), except that the labels on the items are
successive integers or letters instead of bullets.
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@enumerate</literal> command at the beginning of a line.  The

letter as an option.  Without an argument, <literal>@enumerate</literal> starts the
list with the number <literal>1</literal>.  With a numeric argument, such as
<literal>3</literal>, the command starts the list with that number.  With an upper
or lower case letter, such as <literal>a</literal> or <literal>A</literal>, the command starts
the list with that letter.
</para>
<para>Write the text of the enumerated list in the same way you write an

of each paragraph that you want enumerated.  Do not write any other text

<para><literal>@table</literal> is similar to <literal>@itemize</literal> (see <link linkend='itemize'><literal>@itemize</literal></link>), but allows you to specify a name or heading line for
each item.  The <literal>@table</literal> command is used to produce two-column
tables, and is especially useful for glossaries, explanatory
exhibits, and command-line option summaries.
</para>


<sect3 id='table'><title id='table-title'>table</title>
<para>Write the <literal>@table</literal> command at the beginning of a line and follow
it on the same line with an argument that is a Texinfo ``indicating''
command such as <literal>@code</literal>, <literal>@samp</literal>, <literal>@var</literal>, or
<literal>@kbd</literal> (see <link linkend='indicating'>Indicating</link>).  Although these commands are usually
followed by arguments in braces, in this case you use the command name
without an argument because <literal>@item</literal> will supply the argument.
This command will be applied to the text that goes into the first column
of each item and determines how it will be highlighted.  For example,
<literal>@code</literal> will cause the text in the first column to be highlighted
with an <literal>@code</literal> command.  (We recommend <literal>@code</literal> for
<literal>@table</literal>'s of command-line options.)
</para>
<indexterm><primary>asis</primary></indexterm>
<para>You may also choose to use the <literal>@asis</literal> command as an argument to
<literal>@table</literal>.  <literal>@asis</literal> is a command that does nothing; if you
use this command after <literal>@table</literal>, TeX and the Info formatting
commands output the first column entries without added highlighting
(``as is'').
</para>
<para>(The <literal>@table</literal> command may work with other commands besides those
listed here.  However, you can only use commands that normally take
arguments in braces.)
</para>
<indexterm><primary>item</primary></indexterm>
<para>Begin each table entry with an <literal>@item</literal> command at the beginning
of a line.  Write the first column text on the same line as the
<literal>@item</literal> command.  Write the second column text on the line
following the <literal>@item</literal> line and on subsequent lines.  (You do not
need to type anything for an empty second column entry.)  You may
write as many lines of supporting text as you wish, even several
paragraphs.  But only text on the same line as the <literal>@item</literal> will
be placed in the first column, including any footnote.
</para>
<para>Normally, you should put a blank line before an <literal>@item</literal> line.
This puts a blank like in the Info file.  Except when the entries are
very brief, a blank line looks better.
</para>

<para>The following table, for example, highlights the text in the first

<sect1 id='indices'><title id='indices-title'>Indices</title>
<indexterm><primary>Indices</primary></indexterm>

<para>Using Texinfo, you can generate indices without having to sort and
collate entries manually.  In an index, the entries are listed in
alphabetical order, together with information on how to find the
discussion of each entry.  In a printed manual, this information
consists of page numbers.  In an Info file, this information is a menu
entry leading to the first node referenced.
</para>
<para>Texinfo provides several predefined kinds of index: an index
for functions, an index for variables, an index for concepts, and so
on.  You can combine indices or use them for other than their
canonical purpose.  If you wish, you can define your own indices.

<para>When you are making index entries, it is good practice to think of the
different ways people may look for something.  Different people
<emphasis>do not</emphasis> think of the same words when they look something up.  A
helpful index will have items indexed under all the different words
that people may use.  For example, one reader may think it obvious that
the two-letter names for indices should be listed under ``Indices,
two-letter names'', since the word ``Index'' is the general concept.
But another reader may remember the specific concept of two-letter
names and search for the entry listed as ``Two letter names for
indices''.  A good index will have both entries and will help both
readers.
</para>
<para>Like typesetting, the construction of an index is a highly skilled,
professional art, the subtleties of which are not appreciated until you

<para>The data to make an index come from many individual indexing commands
scattered throughout the Texinfo source file.  Each command says to add
one entry to a particular index; after formatting, the index will give
the current page number or node name as the reference.
</para>
<para>An index entry consists of an indexing command at the beginning of a
line followed, on the rest of the line, by the entry.
</para>
<para>For example, this section begins with the following five entries for
the concept index:
</para>
<programlisting>
@cindex Defining indexing entries
@cindex Index entries
@cindex Entries for an index
@cindex Specifying index entries
@cindex Creating index entries
</programlisting>

<para>Each predefined index has its own indexing command---<literal>@cindex</literal>
for the concept index, <literal>@findex</literal> for the function index, and so
on.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Writing index entries</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Index entry writing</primary></indexterm>
<para>Concept index entries consist of text.  The best way to write an index
is to choose entries that are terse yet clear.  If you can do this,
the index often looks better if the entries are not capitalized, but
written just as they would appear in the middle of a sentence.
(Capitalize proper names and acronyms that always call for upper case
letters.)  This is the case convention we use in most GNU manuals'
indices.
</para>
<para>If you don't see how to make an entry terse yet clear, make it longer
and clear---not terse and confusing.  If many of the entries are several
words long, the index may look better if you use a different convention:
to capitalize the first word of each entry.  But do not capitalize a
case-sensitive name such as a C or Lisp function name or a shell
command; that would be a spelling error.
</para>
<para>Whichever case convention you use, please use it consistently!
</para>
<para>Entries in indices other than the concept index are symbol names in
programming languages, or program names; these names are usually
case-sensitive, so use upper and lower case as required for them.
</para>
<para>By default, entries for a concept index are printed in a small roman
font and entries for the other indices are printed in a small
<literal>@code</literal> font.  You may change the way part of an entry is
printed with the usual Texinfo commands, such as <literal>@file</literal> for
file names and <literal>@emph</literal> for emphasis (see <link linkend='marking-text'>Marking Text</link>).

</para></blockquote>
<para>You are not actually required to use the predefined indices for their
canonical purposes.  For example, suppose you wish to index some C
preprocessor macros.  You could put them in the function index along
with actual functions, just by writing <literal>@findex</literal> commands for
them; then, when you print the ``Function Index'' as an unnumbered
chapter, you could give it the title `Function and Macro Index' and
all will be consistent for the reader.  Or you could put the macros in
with the data types by writing <literal>@tindex</literal> commands for them, and
give that index a suitable title so the reader will understand.

<indexterm><primary>Indices, combining them</primary></indexterm>

<para>Sometimes you will want to combine two disparate indices such as functions
and concepts, perhaps because you have few enough of one of them that
a separate index for them would look silly.
</para>
<para>You could put functions into the concept index by writing
<literal>@cindex</literal> commands for them instead of <literal>@findex</literal> commands,
and produce a consistent manual by printing the concept index with the
title `Function and Concept Index' and not printing the `Function
Index' at all; but this is not a robust procedure.  It works only if
your document is never included as part of another
document that is designed to have a separate function index; if your
document were to be included with such a document, the functions from
your document and those from the other would not end up together.
Also, to make your function names appear in the right font in the
concept index, you would need to enclose every one of them between
the braces of <literal>@code</literal>.
</para>

<sect3 id='syncodeindex'><title id='syncodeindex-title'><literal>@syncodeindex</literal></title>

<para>When you want to combine functions and concepts into one index, you

redirect the function index entries into the concept index.
<indexterm><primary>syncodeindex</primary></indexterm>
</para>
<para>The <literal>@syncodeindex</literal> command takes two arguments; they are the name

<para>Write an <literal>@syncodeindex</literal> command before or shortly after the

to merge a function index with a concept index, write the
following:
</para>
<programlisting>
@syncodeindex fn cp
</programlisting>

<para>
This will cause all entries designated for the function index to merge
in with the concept index instead.
</para>
<para>To merge both a variables index and a function index into a concept
index, write the following:
</para>
<programlisting>

@syncodeindex vr cp
@syncodeindex fn cp

</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>Fonts for indices</primary></indexterm>
<para>The <literal>@syncodeindex</literal> command puts all the entries from the `from'
index (the redirected index) into the <literal>@code</literal> font, overriding
whatever default font is used by the index to which the entries are
now directed.  This way, if you direct function names from a function
index into a concept index, all the function names are printed in the
<literal>@code</literal> font as you would expect.

<sect3 id='synindex'><title id='synindex-title'><literal>@synindex</literal></title>

<para>The <literal>@synindex</literal> command is nearly the same as the
<literal>@syncodeindex</literal> command, except that it does not put the
`from' index  entries into the <literal>@code</literal> font; rather it puts
them in the roman font.  Thus, you use <literal>@synindex</literal> when you
merge a concept index into a function index.

<para>In addition to the predefined indices, you may use the
<literal>@defindex</literal> and <literal>@defcodeindex</literal> commands to define new
indices.  These commands create new indexing @-commands with which
you mark index entries.  The <literal>@defindex </literal>command is used like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@defindex name
</programlisting>

<para>The name of an index should be a two letter word, such as <literal>au</literal>.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@defindex au
</programlisting>

<para>This defines a new index, called the <literal>au</literal> index.  At the same
time, it creates a new indexing command, <literal>@auindex</literal>, that you
can use to make index entries.  Use the new indexing command just as
you would use a predefined indexing command.
</para>
<para>For example, here is a section heading followed by a concept index
entry and two <literal>au</literal> index entries.
</para>
<programlisting>
@section Cognitive Semantics
@cindex kinesthetic image schemas
@auindex Johnson, Mark
@auindex Lakoff, George
</programlisting>

<para>
(Evidently, <literal>au</literal> serves here as an abbreviation for ``author''.)
Texinfo constructs the new indexing command by concatenating the name
of the index with <literal>index</literal>; thus, defining an <literal>au</literal> index
leads to the automatic creation of an <literal>@auindex</literal> command.
</para>
<para>Use the <literal>@printindex</literal> command to print the index, as you do with
the predefined indices.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@node Author Index, Subject Index, , Top
@unnumbered Author Index

@printindex au

</programlisting>

<para>The <literal>@defcodeindex</literal> is like the <literal>@defindex</literal> command, except
that, in the printed output, it prints entries in an <literal>@code</literal> font
instead of a roman font.  Thus, it parallels the <literal>@findex</literal> command
rather than the <literal>@cindex</literal> command.
</para>
<para>You should define new indices within or right after the end-of-header

<para>Depending on whether a period or exclamation point or question mark is
inside or at the end of a sentence, less or more space is inserted after
a period in a typeset manual.  Since it is not always possible
to determine when a period ends a sentence and when it is used
in an abbreviation, special commands are needed in some circumstances.
Usually, Texinfo can guess how to handle periods, so you do not need to
use the special commands; you just enter a period as you would if you
were using a typewriter, which means you put two spaces after the
period, question mark, or exclamation mark that ends a sentence.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>&lt;colon&gt; (suppress widening)</primary></indexterm>
<para>Use the <literal>@:</literal> command after a period, question mark,

<para>Ordinarily, TeX collapses multiple whitespace characters (space, tab,

preserves whitespace as you type it, except for changing a newline into
a space; this is why it is important to put two spaces at the end of
sentences in Texinfo documents.
</para>
<para>Occasionally, you may want to actually insert several consecutive
spaces, either for purposes of example (what your program does with
multiple spaces as input), or merely for purposes of appearance in
headings or lists.  Texinfo supports three commands:
<literal>@<keycap>SPACE</keycap></literal>, <literal>@<keycap>TAB</keycap></literal>, and <literal>@<keycap>NL</keycap></literal>, all of
which insert a single space into the output.  (Here,
<literal>@<keycap>SPACE</keycap></literal> represents an <literal>@</literal> character followed by a
space, i.e., <literal>@ </literal>, and <keycap>TAB</keycap> and <keycap>NL</keycap> represent the tab
character and end-of-line, i.e., when <literal>@</literal> is the last character on

<para>At times, you may want to write <literal>12pt</literal> or
<literal>8.5in</literal> with little or no space between the number and the
abbreviation for the dimension.  You can use the <literal>@dmn</literal> command
to do this.  On seeing the command, TeX inserts just enough space
for proper typesetting; the Info formatting commands insert no space
at all, since the Info file does not require it.
</para>
<para>To use the <literal>@dmn</literal> command, write the number and then follow it
immediately, with no intervening space, by <literal>@dmn</literal>, and then by
the dimension within braces.  For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
A4 paper is 8.27@dmn{in} wide.
</programlisting>

<para>
produces
</para>
<blockquote><para>A4 paper is 8.27in wide.
</para></blockquote>
<para>Not everyone uses this style.  Some people prefer <literal>8.27 in.@:</literal>
or <literal>8.27 inches</literal> to <literal>8.27@dmn{in}</literal> in the Texinfo file.
In these cases, however, the formatters may insert a line break between
the number and the dimension, so use <literal>@w</literal> (see <link linkend='w'>w</link>).  Also, if
you write a period after an abbreviation within a sentence, you should
write <literal>@:</literal> after the period to prevent TeX from inserting extra
whitespace, as shown here.  See <link linkend='not-ending-a-sentence'>Not Ending a Sentence</link>.

<para>An <emphasis role='bold'>ellipsis</emphasis> (a line of dots) is not typeset as a string of
periods, so a special command is used for ellipsis in Texinfo.  The
<literal>@bullet</literal> command is special, too.  Each of these commands is
followed by a pair of braces, <literal>{}</literal>, without any whitespace
between the name of the command and the braces.  (You need to use braces
with these commands because you can use them next to other text; without
the braces, the formatters would be confused.  See <link linkend='command-syntax'>@-Command Syntax</link>, for further information.)

<para>Use the <literal>@dots{}</literal> command to generate an ellipsis, which is
three dots in a row, appropriately spaced, like this: `&hellip;'.  Do
not simply write three periods in the input file; that would work for
the Info file output, but would produce the wrong amount of space
between the periods in the printed manual.
</para>
<para>Similarly, the <literal>@enddots{}</literal> command generates an
end-of-sentence ellipsis (four dots) &hellip;

<para>Use the <literal>@minus{}</literal> command to generate a minus sign.  In a

the symbol is the customary length for a minus sign---a little longer

- is a minus sign generated with @minus{},

`-' is a hyphen generated with the character -,

`---' is an em-dash for text.

as a hyphen.
</para>
<para>You should not use <literal>@minus{}</literal> inside <literal>@code</literal> or

</para>
<para><literal>@math</literal> implies <literal>@tex</literal>.  This not only makes it possible to

<sect3 id='footnote-commands'><title id='footnote-commands-title'>Footnote Commands</title>

<para>In Texinfo, footnotes are created with the <literal>@footnote</literal> command.
This command is followed immediately by a left brace, then by the text

be of any length (they will be broken across pages if necessary), but
are usually short.  The template is:
</para>
<programlisting>
ordinary text@footnote{text of footnote}

<para>As shown here, the <literal>@footnote</literal> command should come right after the
text being footnoted, with no intervening space; otherwise, the footnote
marker might end up starting a line.

<para>As you can see, the source includes two punctuation marks next to each
other; in this case, <literal>.};</literal> is the sequence.  This is normal (the
first ends the footnote and the second belongs to the sentence being
footnoted), so don't worry that it looks odd.
</para>
<para>In a printed manual or book, the reference mark for a footnote is a
small, superscripted number; the text of the footnote appears at the
bottom of the page, below a horizontal line.
</para>
<para>In Info, the reference mark for a footnote is a pair of parentheses
with the footnote number between them, like this: <literal>(1)</literal>.  The
reference mark is followed by a cross-reference link to the footnote's
text.
</para>
<para>In the HTML output, footnote references are marked with a small,
superscripted number which is rendered as a hypertext link to the
footnote text.
</para>
<para>By the way, footnotes in the argument of an <literal>@item</literal> command for a
<literal>@table</literal> must be on the same line as the <literal>@item</literal>
(as usual).  See <link linkend='two-dash-column-tables'>Two-column Tables</link>.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id='footnote-styles'><title id='footnote-styles-title'>Footnote Styles</title>

<para>Info has two footnote styles, which determine where the text of the
footnote is located:
</para>
<itemizedlist><indexterm><primary><literal>End</literal> node footnote style</primary></indexterm>
<listitem>
<para>In the `End' node style, all the footnotes for a single node
are placed at the end of that node.  The footnotes are separated from
the rest of the node by a line of dashes with the word
<literal>Footnotes</literal> within it.  Each footnote begins with an
<literal>(n)</literal> reference mark.
</para>

<para>
Here is an example of a single footnote in the end of node style:
</para>
<programlisting>

 --------- Footnotes ---------

(1)  Here is a sample footnote.

</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary><literal>Separate</literal> footnote style</primary></indexterm>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In the `Separate' node style, all the footnotes for a single
node are placed in an automatically constructed node of
their own.  In this style, a ``footnote reference'' follows
each <literal>(n)</literal> reference mark in the body of the
node.  The footnote reference is actually a cross reference
which you use to reach the footnote node.
</para>
<para>The name of the node with the footnotes is constructed
by appending <literal>-Footnotes</literal> to the name of the node
that contains the footnotes. (Consequently, the footnotes'
node for the <filename>Footnotes</filename> node is
<filename>Footnotes-Footnotes</filename>!)  The footnotes' node has an
`Up' node pointer that leads back to its parent node.
</para>
<para>
Here is how the first footnote in this manual looks after being
formatted for Info in the separate node style:
</para>
<programlisting>

File: texinfo.info  Node: Overview-Footnotes, Up: Overview

(1) The first syllable of "Texinfo" is pronounced like "speck", not
"hex". &hellip;

</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>A Texinfo file may be formatted into an Info file with either footnote
style.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>footnotestyle</primary></indexterm>
<para>Use the <literal>@footnotestyle</literal> command to specify an Info file's
footnote style.  Write this command at the beginning of a line followed
by an argument, either <literal>end</literal> for the end node style or
<literal>separate</literal> for the separate node style.
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
@footnotestyle end
</programlisting>
<para>
or
<programlisting>
@footnotestyle separate
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>Write an <literal>@footnotestyle</literal> command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  (If you
include the <literal>@footnotestyle</literal> command between the start-of-header
and end-of-header lines, the region formatting commands will format
footnotes as specified.)
</para>
<para>If you do not specify a footnote style, the formatting commands use
their default style.  Currently, <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> and
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> use the `separate' style and
<literal>makeinfo</literal> uses the `end' style.

<indexterm><primary>Line breaks</primary></indexterm>
<para>Usually, a Texinfo file is processed both by TeX and by one of the
Info formatting commands.  Line, paragraph, or page breaks sometimes
occur in the `wrong' place in one or other form of output.  You must
ensure that text looks right both in the printed manual and in the
Info file.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>White space, excessive</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Page breaks</primary></indexterm>
<para>For example, in a printed manual, page breaks may occur awkwardly in
the middle of an example; to prevent this, you can hold text together
using a grouping command that keeps the text from being split across
two pages.  Conversely, you may want to force a page break where none
would occur normally.  Fortunately, problems like these do not often
arise.  When they do, use the break, break prevention, or pagination
commands.

<para>Although TeX's hyphenation algorithm is generally pretty good, it
does miss useful hyphenation points from time to time.  (Or, far more
rarely, insert an incorrect hyphenation.)  So, for documents with an
unusual vocabulary or when fine-tuning for a printed edition, you may
wish to help TeX out.  Texinfo supports two commands for this:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry><literal>@-</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Insert a discretionary hyphen, i.e., a place where TeX can (but does
not have to) hyphenate.  This is especially useful when you notice
an overfull hbox is due to TeX missing a hyphenation (see <link linkend='overfull-hboxes'>Overfull hboxes</link>).  TeX will not insert any hyphenation points in a word
containing <literal>@-</literal>.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@hyphenation{hy-phen-a-ted words}</literal>
</entry>
<entry>Tell TeX how to hyphenate <literal>hy-phen-a-ted words</literal>.  As shown, you

 TeX only uses the specified hyphenation points when the
words match exactly, so give all necessary variants.

<para>A line containing only <literal>@page</literal> starts a new page in a printed

<para>The <literal>@group</literal> command (on a line by itself) is used inside an

group, which will appear entirely on one page in the printed output.
The group is terminated by a line containing only <literal>@end group</literal>.

output they have no effect at all.

<!--  Once said that these environments -->

<!--  turn off vertical spacing between ``paragraphs''. -->

<!--  Also, quotation used to work, but doesn't in texinfo-2.72 -->

<para>Although <literal>@group</literal> would make sense conceptually in a wide
variety of contexts, its current implementation works reliably only
within <literal>@example</literal> and variants, and within <literal>@display</literal>,
<literal>@format</literal>, <literal>@flushleft</literal> and <literal>@flushright</literal>.
See <link linkend='quotations-and-examples'>Quotations and Examples</link>.  (What all these commands have in
common is that each line of input produces a line of output.)  In
other contexts, <literal>@group</literal> can cause anomalous vertical
spacing.

<para>This formatting requirement means that you should write:

with the <literal>@group</literal> and <literal>@end group</literal> commands inside the

</para>
<para>The <literal>@group</literal> command is most often used to hold an example
together on one page.  In this Texinfo manual, more than 100 examples
contain text that is enclosed between <literal>@group</literal> and <literal>@end group</literal>.
</para>
<para>If you forget to end a group, you may get strange and unfathomable
error messages when you run TeX.  This is because TeX keeps
trying to put the rest of the Texinfo file onto the one page and does
not start to generate error messages until it has processed
considerable text.  It is a good rule of thumb to look for a missing
<literal>@end group</literal> if you get incomprehensible error messages in
TeX.

enable you to describe functions, variables, macros, commands, user

</para>
<para>In the Info file, a definition causes the entity
category---`Function', `Variable', or whatever---to appear at the
beginning of the first line of the definition, followed by the
entity's name and arguments.  In the printed manual, the command
causes TeX to print the entity's name and its arguments on the left
margin and print the category next to the right margin.  In both
output formats, the body of the definition is indented.  Also, the
name of the entity is entered into the appropriate index:
<literal>@deffn</literal> enters the name into the index of functions,
<literal>@defvr</literal> enters it into the index of variables, and so
on.
</para>
<para>A manual need not and should not contain more than one definition for
a given name.  An appendix containing a summary should use
<literal>@table</literal> rather than the definition commands.

<para>The <literal>@deffn</literal> command is used for definitions of entities that
resemble functions.  To write a definition using the <literal>@deffn</literal>
command, write the <literal>@deffn</literal> command at the beginning of a line
and follow it on the same line by the category of the entity, the name
of the entity itself, and its arguments (if any).  Then write the body
of the definition on succeeding lines.  (You may embed examples in the
body.)  Finally, end the definition with an <literal>@end deffn</literal> command
written on a line of its own.  (The other definition commands follow
the same format.)
</para>
<para>The template for a definition looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@deffn category name arguments&hellip;
body-of-definition
@end deffn

</programlisting>


<para>
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>

@deffn Command forward-word count
This command moves point forward @var{count} words
(or backward if @var{count} is negative). &hellip;
@end deffn

</programlisting>

This function moves point forward <literal>count</literal> words
(or backward if <literal>count</literal> is negative). &hellip;
</para></blockquote>
<para>Capitalize the category name like a title.  If the name of the
category contains spaces, as in the phrase `Interactive Command',
write braces around it.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@deffn {Interactive Command} isearch-forward
&hellip;
@end deffn

</programlisting>

<para>
Otherwise, the second word will be mistaken for the name of the
entity.
</para>
<para>Some of the definition commands are more general than others.  The
<literal>@deffn</literal> command, for example, is the general definition command
for functions and the like---for entities that may take arguments.  When
you use this command, you specify the category to which the entity
belongs.  The <literal>@deffn</literal> command possesses three predefined,
specialized variations, <literal>@defun</literal>, <literal>@defmac</literal>, and
<literal>@defspec</literal>, that specify the category for you: ``Function'',
``Macro'', and ``Special Form'' respectively.  (In Lisp, a special form
is an entity much like a function.)  The <literal>@defvr</literal> command also is
accompanied by several predefined, specialized variations for describing
particular kinds of variables.
</para>
<para>The template for a specialized definition, such as <literal>@defun</literal>, is
similar to the template for a generalized definition, except that you
do not need to specify the category:

</para>

<sect3 id='functions-commands'><title id='functions-commands-title'>Functions and Similar Entities</title>

<para>This section describes the commands for describing functions and similar
entities:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<indexterm><primary>deffn</primary></indexterm>
<row><entry><literal>@deffn category name arguments&hellip;</literal>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@deffn</literal> command is the general definition command for
functions, interactive commands, and similar entities that may take
arguments.  You must choose a term to describe the category of entity
being defined; for example, ``Function'' could be used if the entity is
a function.  The <literal>@deffn</literal> command is written at the beginning of a
line and is followed on the same line by the category of entity being
described, the name of this particular entity, and its arguments, if
any.  Terminate the definition with <literal>@end deffn</literal> on a line of its
own.


For example, here is a definition:

<programlisting>

@deffn Command forward-char nchars
Move point forward @var{nchars} characters.
@end deffn

</programlisting>


This shows a rather terse definition for a ``command'' named
<literal>forward-char</literal> with one argument, <literal>nchars</literal>.

<literal>@deffn</literal> prints argument names such as <literal>nchars</literal> in italics or
upper case, as if <literal>@var</literal> had been used, because we think of these
names as metasyntactic variables---they stand for the actual argument
values.  Within the text of the description, write an argument name
explicitly with <literal>@var</literal> to refer to the value of the argument.  In
the example above, we used <literal>@var{nchars}</literal> in this way.

The template for <literal>@deffn</literal> is:

<programlisting>

@deffn category name arguments&hellip;
body-of-definition
@end deffn

</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>defun</primary></indexterm>
</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@defun name arguments&hellip;</literal>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@defun</literal> command is the definition command for functions.
<literal>@defun</literal> is equivalent to <literal>@deffn Function &hellip;</literal>.



For example,

<programlisting>

@defun set symbol new-value
Change the value of the symbol @var{symbol}
to @var{new-value}.
@end defun

</programlisting>


shows a rather terse definition for a function <literal>set</literal> whose
arguments are <literal>symbol</literal> and <literal>new-value</literal>.  The argument names on
the <literal>@defun</literal> line automatically appear in italics or upper case as
if they were enclosed in <literal>@var</literal>.  Terminate the definition with
<literal>@end defun</literal> on a line of its own.

The template is:

<programlisting>

@defun function-name arguments&hellip;
body-of-definition
@end defun

</programlisting>

<literal>@defun</literal> creates an entry in the index of functions.

<indexterm><primary>defmac</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>defvr</primary></indexterm>
<row><entry><literal>@defvr category name</literal>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@defvr</literal> command is a general definition command for
something like a variable---an entity that records a value.  You must
choose a term to describe the category of entity being defined; for
example, ``Variable'' could be used if the entity is a variable.
Write the <literal>@defvr</literal> command at the beginning of a line and
follow it on the same line by the category of the entity and the
name of the entity.

Capitalize the category name like a title.  If the name of the category
contains spaces, as in the name ``User Option'', enclose it in braces.
Otherwise, the second word will be mistaken for the name of the entity.
For example,

<programlisting>

@defvr {User Option} fill-column
This buffer-local variable specifies
the maximum width of filled lines.
&hellip;
@end defvr

</programlisting>

Terminate the definition with <literal>@end defvr</literal> on a line of its
own.

The template is:

<programlisting>

@defvr category name

</programlisting>

<literal>@defvr</literal> creates an entry in the index of variables for <literal>name</literal>.

<sect3 id='typed-functions'><title id='typed-functions-title'>Functions in Typed Languages</title>

<para>The <literal>@deftypefn</literal> command and its variations are for describing
functions in languages in which you must declare types of variables and
functions, such as C and C++.
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<indexterm><primary>deftypefn</primary></indexterm>
<row><entry><literal>@deftypefn category data-type name arguments&hellip;</literal>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@deftypefn</literal> command is the general definition command for
functions and similar entities that may take arguments and that are
typed.  The <literal>@deftypefn</literal> command is written at the beginning of
a line and is followed on the same line by the category of entity
being described, the type of the returned value, the name of this
particular entity, and its arguments, if any.



For example,

<programlisting>

@deftypefn {Library Function} int foobar
   (int @var{foo}, float @var{bar})
&hellip;
@end deftypefn

</programlisting>



(where the text before the ``&hellip;'', shown above as two lines, would
actually be a single line in a real Texinfo file) produces the following
in Info:

<programlisting>

-- Library Function: int foobar (int FOO, float BAR)
&hellip;

</programlisting>

This means that <literal>foobar</literal> is a ``library function'' that returns an
<literal>int</literal>, and its arguments are <literal>foo</literal> (an <literal>int</literal>) and
<literal>bar</literal> (a <literal>float</literal>).

The argument names that you write in <literal>@deftypefn</literal> are not subject
to an implicit <literal>@var</literal>---since the actual names of the arguments in
<literal>@deftypefn</literal> are typically scattered among data type names and
keywords, Texinfo cannot find them without help.  Instead, you must write
<literal>@var</literal> explicitly around the argument names.  In the example
above, the argument names are <literal>foo</literal> and <literal>bar</literal>.

The template for <literal>@deftypefn</literal> is:

<programlisting>

@deftypefn category data-type name arguments &hellip;
body-of-description
@end deftypefn

</programlisting>


Note that if the <literal>category</literal> or <literal>data type</literal> is more than one
word then it must be enclosed in braces to make it a single argument.

If you are describing a procedure in a language that has packages,
such as Ada, you might consider using <literal>@deftypefn</literal> in a manner
somewhat contrary to the convention described in the preceding
paragraphs.



For example:

<programlisting>

@deftypefn stacks private push
        (@var{s}:in out stack;
        @var{n}:in integer)
&hellip;
@end deftypefn

</programlisting>


(The <literal>@deftypefn</literal> arguments are shown split into three lines, but
would be a single line in a real Texinfo file.)

In this instance, the procedure is classified as belonging to the
package <literal>stacks</literal> rather than classified as a `procedure' and its
data type is described as <literal>private</literal>.  (The name of the procedure
is <literal>push</literal>, and its arguments are <literal>s</literal> and <literal>n</literal>.)

<literal>@deftypefn</literal> creates an entry in the index of functions for
<literal>name</literal>.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry><literal>@deftypefun data-type name arguments&hellip;</literal>
<indexterm><primary>deftypefun</primary></indexterm>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@deftypefun</literal> command is the specialized definition command
for functions in typed languages.  The command is equivalent to
<literal>@deftypefn Function &hellip;</literal>.



Thus,

<programlisting>

@deftypefun int foobar (int @var{foo}, float @var{bar})
&hellip;
@end deftypefun

</programlisting>


produces the following in Info:

<programlisting>

-- Function: int foobar (int FOO, float BAR)
&hellip;

</programlisting>


The template is:

<programlisting>

@deftypefun type name arguments&hellip;
body-of-description

</row>
<row><entry><literal>@defop category class name arguments&hellip;</literal>
</entry>
<entry>The <literal>@defop</literal> command is the general definition command for
entities that may resemble methods in object-oriented programming.
These entities take arguments, as functions do, but are associated with
particular classes of objects.

For example, some systems have constructs called <emphasis role='bold'>wrappers</emphasis> that
are associated with classes as methods are, but that act more like
macros than like functions.  You could use <literal>@defop Wrapper</literal> to
describe one of these.

Sometimes it is useful to distinguish methods and <emphasis role='bold'>operations</emphasis>.
You can think of an operation as the specification for a method.
Thus, a window system might specify that all window classes have a
method named <literal>expose</literal>; we would say that this window system
defines an <literal>expose</literal> operation on windows in general.  Typically,
the operation has a name and also specifies the pattern of arguments;
all methods that implement the operation must accept the same
arguments, since applications that use the operation do so without
knowing which method will implement it.

Often it makes more sense to document operations than methods.  For
example, window application developers need to know about the
<literal>expose</literal> operation, but need not be concerned with whether a
given class of windows has its own method to implement this operation.
To describe this operation, you would write:

<programlisting>
@defop Operation windows expose
</programlisting>

The <literal>@defop</literal> command is written at the beginning of a line and
is followed on the same line by the overall name of the category of
operation, the name of the class of the operation, the name of the
operation, and its arguments, if any.

The template is:
<programlisting>

@defop category class name arguments&hellip;
body-of-definition
@end defop

</programlisting>

<literal>@defop</literal> creates an entry, such as `<literal>expose</literal> on

<para>A function definition uses the <literal>@defun</literal> and <literal>@end defun</literal>
commands.  The name of the function follows immediately after the
<literal>@defun</literal> command and it is followed, on the same line, by the
parameter list.
</para>
<para>Here is a definition from (elisp).

<literal>apply</literal> calls <literal>function</literal> with <literal>arguments</literal>, just
like <literal>funcall</literal> but with one difference: the last of
<literal>arguments</literal> is a list of arguments to give to
<literal>function</literal>, rather than a single argument.  We also say
that this list is <emphasis role='bold'>appended</emphasis> to the other arguments.
</para>
<para><literal>apply</literal> returns the result of calling <literal>function</literal>.
As with <literal>funcall</literal>, <literal>function</literal> must either be a Lisp
function or a primitive function; special forms and macros
do not make sense in <literal>apply</literal>.

<para>In the Texinfo source file, this example looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@defun apply function &amp;rest arguments
@code{apply} calls @var{function} with
@var{arguments}, just like @code{funcall} but with one
difference: the last of @var{arguments} is a list of
arguments to give to @var{function}, rather than a single
argument.  We also say that this list is @dfn{appended}
to the other arguments.



@code{apply} returns the result of calling
@var{function}.  As with @code{funcall},
@var{function} must either be a Lisp function or a
primitive function; special forms and macros do not make
sense in @code{apply}.



@example
(setq f 'list)
     @result{} list
(apply f 'x 'y 'z)
@error{} Wrong type argument: listp, z
(apply '+ 1 2 '(3 4))
     @result{} 10
(apply '+ '(1 2 3 4))
     @result{} 10

(apply 'append '((a b c) nil (x y z) nil))
     @result{} (a b c x y z)
@end example



An interesting example of using @code{apply} is found
in the description of @code{mapcar}.
@end defun

<indexterm><primary>ifinfo</primary></indexterm>
<para><literal>@ifinfo</literal> begins segments of text that should be ignored by TeX
when it typesets the printed manual.  The segment of text appears only
in the Info file.  The <literal>@ifinfo</literal> command should appear on a line
by itself; end the Info-only text with a line containing <literal>@end ifinfo</literal> by itself.  At the beginning of a Texinfo file, the Info
permissions are contained within a region marked by <literal>@ifinfo</literal> and
<literal>@end ifinfo</literal>. (See <link linkend='info-summary-and-permissions'>Info Summary and Permissions</link>.)
</para>
<indexterm><primary>iftex</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ifhtml</primary></indexterm>
<para>The <literal>@iftex</literal> and <literal>@end iftex</literal> commands are similar to the
<literal>@ifinfo</literal> and <literal>@end ifinfo</literal> commands, except that they
specify text that will appear in the printed manual but not in the Info
file.  Likewise for <literal>@ifhtml</literal> and <literal>@end ifhtml</literal>, which
specify text to appear only in HTML output.
</para>
<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
@iftex
This text will appear only in the printed manual.
@end iftex
@ifinfo
However, this text will appear only in Info.
@end ifinfo
@ifhtml

<para>You can specify text to be included in any output format <emphasis>other</emphasis>

<programlisting>
@ifnothtml &hellip; @end ifnothtml
@ifnotinfo &hellip; @end ifnotinfo

(The <literal>@ifnot&hellip;</literal> command and the <literal>@end</literal> command must
actually appear on lines by themselves.)
</para>
<para>If the output file is not being made for the given format, the region is
included.  Otherwise, it is ignored.
</para>
<para>The regions delimited by these commands are ordinary Texinfo source as
with <literal>@iftex</literal>, not raw formatter source as with <literal>@tex</literal>
(see <link linkend='raw-formatter-commands'>Raw Formatter Commands</link>).

<indexterm><primary>plain TeX</primary></indexterm>

<para>Inside a region delineated by <literal>@iftex</literal> and <literal>@end iftex</literal>, you
can embed some raw TeX commands.  Info will ignore these commands
since they are only in that part of the file which is seen by TeX.
You can write the TeX commands as you would write them in a normal
TeX file, except that you must replace the <literal>\</literal> used by TeX
with an <literal>@</literal>.  For example, in the <literal>@titlepage</literal> section of a
Texinfo file, you can use the TeX command <literal>@vskip</literal> to format
the copyright page.  (The <literal>@titlepage</literal> command causes Info to
ignore the region automatically, as it does with the <literal>@iftex</literal>
command.)
</para>
<para>However, many features of plain TeX will not work, as they are
overridden by Texinfo features.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>tex</primary></indexterm>
<para>You can enter plain TeX completely, and use <literal>\</literal> in the TeX
commands, by delineating a region with the <literal>@tex</literal> and <literal>@end tex</literal> commands.  (The <literal>@tex</literal> command also causes Info to ignore the
region, like the <literal>@iftex</literal> command.)  The sole exception is that the
<literal>@</literal> character still introduces a command, so that <literal>@end tex</literal>
can be recognized properly.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Mathematical expressions</primary></indexterm>
<para>For example, here is a mathematical expression written in
plain TeX:
</para>

@tex
$$ \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N

          \over \sigma_i\right)^2 $$
@end tex

The output of this example will appear only in a printed manual.  If
you are reading this in Info, you will not see the equation that appears
in the printed manual.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>ifhtml</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>html</primary></indexterm>
<para>Analogously, you can use <literal>@ifhtml &hellip; @end ifhtml</literal> to delimit
a region to be included in HTML output only, and <literal>@html &hellip; @end html</literal> for a region of raw HTML (again, except that <literal>@</literal> is
still the escape character, so the <literal>@end</literal> command can be
recognized.)

<sect3 id='set-value'><title id='set-value-title'><literal>@set</literal> and <literal>@value</literal></title>
<indexterm><primary>value</primary></indexterm>

<para>You use the <literal>@set</literal> command to specify a value for a flag, which is
later expanded by the <literal>@value</literal> command.
</para>
<para>A <emphasis role='bold'>flag</emphasis> is an identifier.  In general, it is best to use only
letters and numerals in a flag name, not <literal>-</literal> or <literal>_</literal>---they
will work in some contexts, but not all, due to limitations in TeX.
</para>
<para>The value is the remainder of the input line, and can contain anything.
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@set</literal> command like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@set foo This is a string.
</programlisting>

<para>
This sets the value of the flag <literal>foo</literal> to ``This is a string.''.
</para>
<para>The Texinfo formatters then replace an <literal>@value{flag}</literal>
command with the string to which <literal>flag</literal> is set.  Thus, when
<literal>foo</literal> is set as shown above, the Texinfo formatters convert this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@value{foo}
This is a string.

</programlisting>

<para>You can write an <literal>@value</literal> command within a paragraph; but you
must write an <literal>@set</literal> command on a line of its own.
</para>
<para>If you write the <literal>@set</literal> command like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@set foo
</programlisting>

<para>
without specifying a string, the value of <literal>foo</literal> is the empty string.
</para>
<para>If you clear a previously set flag with <literal>@clear flag</literal>, a
subsequent <literal>@value{flag}</literal> command will report an error.
</para>
<para>For example, if you set <literal>foo</literal> as follows:
</para>
<programlisting>
@set how-much very, very, very
</programlisting>

<para>
then the formatters transform
</para>
<programlisting>

It is a @value{how-much} wet day.
It is a very, very, very wet day.

</programlisting>

<para>If you write
</para>
<programlisting>
@clear how-much
</programlisting>

<para>
then the formatters transform
</para>
<programlisting>

It is a @value{how-much} wet day.
It is a {No value for "how-much"} wet day.

<indexterm><primary>ifset</primary></indexterm>
<para>When a <literal>flag</literal> is set, the Texinfo formatting commands format text
between subsequent pairs of <literal>@ifset flag</literal> and <literal>@end ifset</literal> commands.  When the <literal>flag</literal> is cleared, the Texinfo formatting
commands do <emphasis>not</emphasis> format the text.  <literal>@ifclear</literal> operates
analogously.
</para>
<para>Write the conditionally formatted text between <literal>@ifset flag</literal>
and <literal>@end ifset</literal> commands, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

@ifset flag
conditional-text
@end ifset

</programlisting>

<para>For example, you can create one document that has two variants, such as
a manual for a `large' and `small' model:
</para>
<indexterm><primary>shrubbery</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
You can use this machine to dig up shrubs
without hurting them.

@set large

@ifset large
It can also dig up fully grown trees.
@end ifset

</programlisting>

<para>
In the example, the formatting commands will format the text between
<literal>@ifset large</literal> and <literal>@end ifset</literal> because the <literal>large</literal>
flag is set.
</para>
<para>When <literal>flag</literal> is cleared, the Texinfo formatting commands do
<emphasis>not</emphasis> format the text between <literal>@ifset flag</literal> and
<literal>@end ifset</literal>; that text is ignored and does not appear in either
printed or Info output.
</para>
<para>For example, if you clear the flag of the preceding example by writing
an <literal>@clear large</literal> command after the <literal>@set large</literal> command
(but before the conditional text), then the Texinfo formatting commands
ignore the text between the <literal>@ifset large</literal> and <literal>@end ifset</literal>
commands.  In the formatted output, that text does not appear; in both
printed and Info output, you see only the lines that say, ``You can use
this machine to dig up shrubs without hurting them.  Remember to replant
promptly &hellip;''.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>ifclear</primary></indexterm>
<para>If a flag is cleared with an <literal>@clear flag</literal> command, then
the formatting commands format text between subsequent pairs of
<literal>@ifclear</literal> and <literal>@end ifclear</literal> commands.  But if the flag
is set with <literal>@set flag</literal>, then the formatting commands do
<emphasis>not</emphasis> format text between an <literal>@ifclear</literal> and an <literal>@end ifclear</literal> command; rather, they ignore that text.  An <literal>@ifclear</literal>

<para>Texinfo provides several ways to define new commands:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>A Texinfo <emphasis role='bold'>macro</emphasis> allows you to define a new Texinfo command as any
sequence of text and/or existing commands (including other macros).  The
macro can have any number of <emphasis role='bold'>parameters</emphasis>---text you supply each
time you use the macro.
</para>
<para>Incidentally, these macros have nothing to do with the <literal>@defmac</literal>
command, which is for documenting macros in the subject of the manual
(see <link linkend='def-cmd-template'>Def Cmd Template</link>).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>@alias</literal> is a convenient way to define a new name for an existing

</para>
</listitem>

<sect2 id='defining-macros'><title id='defining-macros-title'>Defining Macros</title>
<indexterm><primary>Defining macros</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Macro definitions</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>macro</primary></indexterm>
<para>You use the Texinfo <literal>@macro</literal> command to define a macro, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macro macroname{param1, param2, &hellip;}
text &hellip; \param1\ &hellip;
@end macro
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis role='bold'>parameters</emphasis> <literal>param1</literal>, <literal>param2</literal>, &hellip; correspond to
arguments supplied when the macro is subsequently used in the document
(described in the next section).
</para>
<para>For a macro to work with TeX, <literal>macroname</literal> must consist entirely
of letters: no digits, hyphens, underscores, or other special characters.
</para>
<para>If a macro needs no parameters, you can define it either with an empty
list (<literal>@macro foo {}</literal>) or with no braces at all (<literal>@macro foo</literal>).
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Body of a macro</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Mutually recursive macros</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Recursion, mutual</primary></indexterm>
<para>The definition or <emphasis role='bold'>body</emphasis> of the macro can contain most Texinfo
commands, including previously-defined macros.  Not-yet-defined macro
invocations are not allowed; thus, it is not possible to have mutually
recursive Texinfo macros.  Also, a macro definition that defines another
macro does not work in TeX due to limitations in the design of
<literal>@macro</literal>.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Parameters to macros</primary></indexterm>
<para>In the macro body, instances of a parameter name surrounded by
backslashes, as in <literal>\param1\</literal> in the example above, are
replaced by the corresponding argument from the macro invocation.  You
can use parameter names any number of times in the body, including zero.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Backslash in macros</primary></indexterm>
<para>To get a single <literal>\</literal> in the macro expansion, use <literal>\\</literal>.  Any
other use of <literal>\</literal> in the body yields a warning.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Spaces in macros</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Whitespace in macros</primary></indexterm>
<para>The newlines after the <literal>@macro</literal> line and before the <literal>@end macro</literal> line are ignored, that is, not included in the macro body.  All
other whitespace is treated according to the usual Texinfo rules.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Recursive macro invocations</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>rmacro</primary></indexterm>
<para>To allow a macro to be used recursively, that is, in an argument to a
call to itself, you must define it with <literal>@rmacro</literal>, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@rmacro rmac {arg}
a\arg\b
@end rmacro
&hellip;
@rmac{1@rmac{text}2}
</programlisting>

<para>This produces the output `a1atextb2b'.  With <literal>@macro</literal> instead of
<literal>@rmacro</literal>, an error message is given.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>unmacro</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Macros, undefining</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Undefining macros</primary></indexterm>
<para>You can undefine a macro <literal>foo</literal> with <literal>@unmacro foo</literal>.
It is not an error to undefine a macro that is already undefined.
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@unmacro foo
</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>Expanding macros</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Running macros</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Macro invocation</primary></indexterm>

<para>After a macro is defined (see the previous section), you can use
(<emphasis role='bold'>invoke</emphasis>) it in your document like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macroname {arg1, arg2, &hellip;}
</programlisting>

<para> and the result will be just as if you typed the body of
<literal>macroname</literal> at that spot.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macro foo {p, q}
Together: \p\ &amp; \q\.
@end macro
@foo{a, b}
</programlisting>

<para> produces:
</para>
<literallayout>
Together: a &amp; b.
</literallayout>

<indexterm><primary>Backslash, and macros</primary></indexterm>
<para>Thus, the arguments and parameters are separated by commas and delimited
by braces; any whitespace after (but not before) a comma is ignored.
The braces are required in the invocation (but not the definition), even
when the macro takes no arguments, consistent with all other Texinfo
commands.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macro argless {}
No arguments here.
@end macro
@argless{}
</programlisting>

<para> produces:
</para>
<literallayout>
No arguments here.
</literallayout>

<indexterm><primary>Comma, in macro arguments</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Braces, in macro arguments</primary></indexterm>
<para>To insert a comma, brace, or backslash in an argument, prepend a
backslash, as in
</para>
<programlisting>
@macname {\\\{\}\,}
</programlisting>

<para>
which will pass the (almost certainly error-producing) argument
<literal>\{},</literal> to <literal>macname</literal>.  However, commas in parameters, even
if escaped by a backslash, might cause trouble in TeX.
</para>
<para>If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked
without any braces, the entire rest of the line after the macro name is
supplied as the argument.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macro bar {p}
Twice: \p\ &amp; \p\.
@end macro
@bar aah
</programlisting>

<para> produces:
</para>
<!--  Sorry for cheating, but let's not require macros to process the manual. -->

<literallayout>
Twice: aah &amp; aah.
</literallayout>

<para>If the macro is defined to take a single argument, and is invoked with
braces, the braced text is passed as the argument, regardless of
commas.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@macro bar {p}
Twice: \p\ &amp; \p\.
@end macro
@bar{a,b}
</programlisting>

<para> produces:
</para>

</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>All macros are expanded inside at least one TeX group.  This means
that <literal>@set</literal> and other such commands will have no effect inside a
macro.
</para>

<listitem>
<para>Commas in macro arguments, even if escaped by a backslash, don't
always work.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The TeX implementation cannot construct macros that define macros in
the natural way.  To do this, you must use conditionals and raw TeX.
For example:
</para>

@macro \name\
something involving \arg\ somehow
@end macro
@end macro

<indexterm><primary>Aliases, command</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Command aliases</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>alias</primary></indexterm>

<para>The <literal>@alias</literal> command defines a new command to be just like an
existing one.  This is useful for defining additional markup names, thus
preserving semantic information in the input even though the output
result may be the same.
</para>
<para>Write the <literal>@alias</literal> command on a line by itself, followed by the
new command name, an equals sign, and the existing command name.
Whitespace around the equals sign is ignored.  Thus:
<programlisting>
@alias new = existing
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>For example, if your document contains citations for both books and
some other media (movies, for example), you might like to define a
macro <literal>@moviecite{}</literal> that does the same thing as an ordinary
<literal>@cite{}</literal> but conveys the extra semantic information as well.
You'd do this as follows:
</para>
<programlisting>
@alias moviecite = cite
</programlisting>

<para>Macros do not always have the same effect due to vagaries of argument
parsing.  Also, aliases are much simpler to define than macros.  So the
command is not redundant.  (It was also heavily used in the Jargon File!)
</para>
<para>Aliases must not be recursive, directly or indirectly.

<indexterm><primary>Highlighting, customized</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Customized highlighting</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>definfoenclose</primary></indexterm>

<para>A <literal>@definfoenclose</literal> command may be used to define a highlighting
command for Info, but not for TeX.  A command defined using
<literal>@definfoenclose</literal> marks text by enclosing it in strings that
precede and follow the text.  You can use this to get closer control of
your Info output.
</para> 
<para>Presumably, if you define a command with <literal>@definfoenclose</literal> for Info,
you will create a corresponding command for TeX, either in
<filename>texinfo.tex</filename>, <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename>, or within an <literal>@iftex</literal> in
your document.
</para>
<para>Write a <literal>@definfoenclose</literal> command on a line and follow it with
three arguments separated by commas.  The first argument to
<literal>@definfoenclose</literal> is the @-command name (without the <literal>@</literal>);
the second argument is the Info start delimiter string; and the third
argument is the Info end delimiter string.  The latter two arguments
enclose the highlighted text in the Info file.  A delimiter string may
contain spaces.  Neither the start nor end delimiter is required.  If
you do not want a start delimiter but do want an end delimiter, you must
follow the command name with two commas in a row; otherwise, the Info
formatting commands will naturally misinterpret the end delimiter string
you intended as the start delimiter string.
</para>
<para>If you do a <literal>@definfoenclose</literal> on the name of a pre-defined macro
(such as <literal>@emph</literal>, <literal>@strong</literal>, <literal>@t</literal>, or <literal>@i</literal>), the
enclosure definition will override the built-in definition.
</para> 
<para>An enclosure command defined this way takes one argument in braces; this
is intended for new markup commands (see <link linkend='marking-text'>Marking Text</link>).
</para>
<indexterm><primary>phoo</primary></indexterm>
<para>For example, you can write:
</para>
<programlisting>
@definfoenclose phoo,//,\\
</programlisting>

<para>
near the beginning of a Texinfo file to define <literal>@phoo</literal> as an Info
formatting command that inserts `//' before and `\\' after the argument
to <literal>@phoo</literal>.  You can then write <literal>@phoo{bar}</literal> wherever you
want `//bar\\' highlighted in Info.
</para>
<para>Also, for TeX formatting, you could write 
</para>
<programlisting>
@iftex
@global@let@phoo=@i
@end iftex
</programlisting>

<para>
to define <literal>@phoo</literal> as a command that causes TeX to typeset the
argument to <literal>@phoo</literal> in italics.
</para>
<para>Each definition applies to its own formatter: one for TeX, the other
for <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> or <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal>.  The
<literal>@definfoenclose</literal> command need not be within <literal>@ifinfo</literal>, but
the raw TeX commands do need to be in <literal>@iftex</literal>.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>headword</primary></indexterm>
<para>Here is another example: write
</para>
<programlisting>
@definfoenclose headword, , :
</programlisting>

<para>
near the beginning of the file, to define <literal>@headword</literal> as an Info
formatting command that inserts nothing before and a colon after the
argument to <literal>@headword</literal>.

<para>There are three major shell commands for making a printed manual from a
Texinfo file: one for converting the Texinfo file into a file that will be
printed, a second for sorting indices, and a third for printing the
formatted document.  When you use the shell commands, you can either
work directly in the operating system shell or work within a shell
inside GNU Emacs.
</para>
<para>If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use commands provided by Texinfo
mode instead of shell commands.  In addition to the three commands to
format a file, sort the indices, and print the result, Texinfo mode
offers key bindings for commands to recenter the output buffer, show the
print queue, and delete a job from the print queue.
</para>

<sect2 id='use-tex'><title id='use-tex-title'>Use TeX</title>

<para>The typesetting program called TeX is used for formatting a Texinfo
file.  TeX is a very powerful typesetting program and, if used correctly,
does an exceptionally good job.  (See <link linkend='obtaining-tex'>How to Obtain TeX</link>, for information on how to obtain TeX.)
</para>
<para>The standalone <literal>makeinfo</literal> program and Emacs functions
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> and <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> commands
read the very same @-commands in the Texinfo file as does TeX, but
process them differently to make an Info file (see <link linkend='creating-an-info-file'>Creating an Info File</link>).

<indexterm><primary>DVI file</primary></indexterm>

<para>Format the Texinfo file with the shell command <literal>tex</literal> followed by
the name of the Texinfo file.  For example:
</para>
<programlisting>
tex foo.texi
</programlisting>

<para> TeX will produce a <emphasis role='bold'>DVI file</emphasis> as well as several auxiliary
files containing information for indices, cross references, etc.  The
DVI file (for <emphasis role='bold'>DeVice Independent</emphasis> file) can be printed on virtually
any device (see the following sections).
</para>
<para>The <literal>tex</literal> formatting command itself does not sort the indices; it
writes an output file of unsorted index data.  (The <literal>texi2dvi</literal>
command automatically generates indices; see <link linkend='format-with-texi-two-dvi'>Format with <literal>texi2dvi</literal></link>.)  To generate a printed index after
running the <literal>tex</literal> command, you first need a sorted index to work
from.  The <literal>texindex</literal> command sorts indices.  (The source file
<filename>texindex.c</filename> comes as part of the standard Texinfo distribution,
among other places.)
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Names of index files</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Index file names</primary></indexterm>
<para>The <literal>tex</literal> formatting command outputs unsorted index files under
names that obey a standard convention: the name of your main input file
with any <literal>.tex</literal> (or similar, see (web2c)) extension removed, followed by the two letter names of indices.
For example, the raw index output files for the input file
<filename>foo.texinfo</filename> would be <filename>foo.cp</filename>, <filename>foo.vr</filename>, <filename>foo.fn</filename>,
<filename>foo.tp</filename>, <filename>foo.pg</filename> and <filename>foo.ky</filename>.  Those are exactly the
arguments to give to <literal>texindex</literal>.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>Wildcards</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Globbing</primary></indexterm>
<para>Instead of specifying all the unsorted index file names explicitly, you
can use <literal>??</literal> as shell wildcards and give the command in this
form:
</para>
<programlisting>
texindex foo.??
</programlisting>

<para>
This command will run <literal>texindex</literal> on all the unsorted index files,
including any that you have defined yourself using <literal>@defindex</literal>
or <literal>@defcodeindex</literal>.  (You may execute <literal>texindex foo.??</literal>
even if there are similarly named files with two letter extensions
that are not index files, such as <literal>foo.el</literal>.  The <literal>texindex</literal>
command reports but otherwise ignores such files.)
</para>
<para>For each file specified, <literal>texindex</literal> generates a sorted index file
whose name is made by appending <literal>s</literal> to the input file name.  The
<literal>@printindex</literal> command looks for a file with that name
(see <link linkend='printing-indices-and-menus'>Printing Indices &amp; Menus</link>).  <literal>texindex</literal> does not alter the
raw index output file.
</para>
<para>After you have sorted the indices, you need to rerun the <literal>tex</literal>
formatting command on the Texinfo file.  This regenerates the DVI file,
this time with up-to-date index entries.
</para>
<para>Finally, you may need to run <literal>tex</literal> one more time, to get the page
numbers in the cross-references correct.
</para>
<para>To summarize, this is a five step process:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>Run <literal>tex</literal> on your Texinfo file.  This generates a DVI file (with
undefined cross-references and no indices), and the raw index files
(with two letter extensions).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Run <literal>texindex</literal> on the raw index files.  This creates the
corresponding sorted index files (with three letter extensions).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Run <literal>tex</literal> again on your Texinfo file.  This regenerates the DVI
file, this time with indices and defined cross-references, but with page
numbers for the cross-references from last time, generally incorrect.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Sort the indices again, with <literal>texindex</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Run <literal>tex</literal> one last time.  This time the correct page numbers are
written for the cross-references.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Alternatively, it's a one-step process: run <literal>texi2dvi</literal>
(see <link linkend='format-with-texi-two-dvi'>Format with texi2dvi</link>).
</para>
<para>You need not run <literal>texindex</literal> each time after you run <literal>tex</literal>.  If
you do not, on the next run, the <literal>tex</literal> formatting command will use
whatever sorted index files happen to exist from the previous use of
<literal>texindex</literal>.  This is usually ok while you are debugging.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>novalidate</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>Chapters, formatting one at a time</primary></indexterm>
<para>Sometimes you may wish to print a document while you know it is
incomplete, or to print just one chapter of a document.  In that case,
the usual auxiliary files that TeX creates and warnings TeX gives
when cross-references are not satisfied are just nuisances.  You can
avoid them with the <literal>@novalidate</literal> command, which you must give
<emphasis>before</emphasis> the <literal>@setfilename</literal> command
(see <link linkend='setfilename'><literal>@setfilename</literal></link>).  Thus, the beginning of
your file would look approximately like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
@novalidate
@setfilename myfile.info
&hellip;
</programlisting>

<para> <literal>@novalidate</literal> also turns off validation in
<literal>makeinfo</literal>, just like its <literal>--no-validate</literal> option
(see <link linkend='pointer-validation'>Pointer Validation</link>).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id='format-with-texi-two-dvi'><title id='format-with-texi-two-dvi-title'>Format with <literal>texi2dvi</literal></title>

<para>The <literal>texi2dvi</literal> command automatically runs both <literal>tex</literal> and
<literal>texindex</literal> as many times as necessary to produce a DVI file with
sorted indices and all cross-references resolved.  It simplifies the
<literal>tex</literal>---<literal>texindex</literal>---<literal>tex</literal>---<literal>tex</literal> sequence
described in the previous section.
</para>
<para>To run <literal>texi2dvi</literal> on an input file <filename>foo.texi</filename>, do this (where
<literal>prompt$ </literal> is your shell prompt):
</para>
<programlisting>
prompt$ <keycap>texi2dvi</keycap><keycap>foo.texi</keycap>
</programlisting>

<para>As shown in this example, the input filenames to <literal>texi2dvi</literal> must
include any extension (<literal>.texi</literal>, <literal>.texinfo</literal>, etc.).  Under
MS-DOS and perhaps in other circumstances, you may need to run <literal>sh texi2dvi foo.texi</literal> instead of relying on the operating system to invoke
the shell on the <literal>texi2dvi</literal> script.
</para>
<para>Perhaps the most useful option to <literal>texi2dvi</literal> is
<literal>--texinfo=cmd</literal>.  This inserts <literal>cmd</literal> on a line by itself
after the <literal>@setfilename</literal> in a temporary copy of the input file
before running TeX.  With this, you can specify different printing
formats, such as <literal>@smallbook</literal> (see <link linkend='smallbook'>smallbook</link>),
<literal>@afourpaper</literal> (see <link linkend='a-four-paper'>A4 Paper</link>), or <literal>@pagesizes</literal>
(see <link linkend='pagesizes'>pagesizes</link>), without actually changing the document source.
(You can also do this on a site-wide basis with <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename>;
see <link linkend='preparing-for-tex'>Preparing for TeX</link>).

C-c C-t C-p             Print the DVI file.
C-c C-t C-q             Display the printer queue.

</programlisting>

<para>The Texinfo mode TeX formatting commands start a subshell in Emacs
called the <filename>*tex-shell*</filename>.  The <literal>texinfo-tex-command</literal>,
<literal>texinfo-texindex-command</literal>, and <literal>tex-dvi-print-command</literal>
commands are all run in this shell.
</para>
<para>You can watch the commands operate in the <literal>*tex-shell*</literal> buffer,
and you can switch to and from and use the <literal>*tex-shell*</literal> buffer
as you would any other shell buffer.
</para>

<para>The formatting and print commands depend on the values of several variables.
The default values are:
</para>
<programlisting>

     Variable                              Default value

<para>Yet another way to apply the TeX formatting command to a Texinfo file
is to put that command in a <emphasis role='bold'>local variables list</emphasis> at the end of the
Texinfo file.  You can then specify the <literal>tex</literal> or <literal>texi2dvi</literal>
commands as a <literal>compile-command</literal> and have Emacs run it by typing
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>compile</keycap>.  This creates a special shell called the
<filename>*compilation*</filename> buffer in which Emacs runs the compile command.
For example, at the end of the <filename>gdb.texinfo</filename> file, after the
<literal>@bye</literal>, you could put the following:
</para>
<programlisting>

Local Variables:
compile-command: "texi2dvi gdb.texinfo"

</para>
<programlisting>
@setfilename arg-not-used-by-TeX
</programlisting>

<para>

<para>TeX needs to know where to find the <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> file that the
<literal>\input texinfo</literal> command on the first line reads.  The
<filename>texinfo.tex</filename> file tells TeX how to handle @-commands; it is
included in all standard GNU distributions.
</para>

<para>Usually, the installer has put the <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> file in the
default directory that contains TeX macros when GNU Texinfo, Emacs or
other GNU software is installed.  In this case, TeX will find the
file and you do not need to do anything special.  If this has not been
done, you can put <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> in the current directory when you
run TeX, and TeX will find it there.
</para>
<para>Also, you should install <filename>epsf.tex</filename>, if it is not already installed
from another distribution.  More details are at the end of the description
of the <literal>@image</literal> command (see <link linkend='images'>Images</link>).
</para>
<para>Likewise for <filename>pdfcolor.tex</filename>, if it is not already installed and you
use pdftex.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Customizing of TeX for Texinfo</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Site-wide Texinfo configuration file</primary></indexterm>
<para>Optionally, you may create an additional <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename>, and install
it as well.  This file is read by TeX when the <literal>@setfilename</literal>
command is executed (see <link linkend='setfilename'><literal>@setfilename</literal></link>).  You can put any
commands you like there, according to local site-wide conventions.  They
will be read by TeX when processing any Texinfo document.  For
example, if <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename> contains the line <literal>@afourpaper</literal>
(see <link linkend='a-four-paper'>A4 Paper</link>), then all Texinfo documents will be processed with
that page size in effect.  If you have nothing to put in
<filename>texinfo.cnf</filename>, you do not need to create it.
</para>
<para>If neither of the above locations for these system files suffice for
you, you can specify the directories explicitly.  For
<filename>texinfo.tex</filename>, you can do this by writing the complete path for the
file after the <literal>\input</literal> command.  Another way, that works for both
<filename>texinfo.tex</filename> and <filename>texinfo.cnf</filename> (and any other file TeX
might read), is to set the <literal>TEXINPUTS</literal> environment variable in your
<filename>.cshrc</filename> or <filename>.profile</filename> file.
</para>
<para>Which you use of <filename>.cshrc</filename> or <filename>.profile</filename> depends on
whether you use a Bourne shell-compatible (<literal>sh</literal>, <literal>bash</literal>,
<literal>ksh</literal>, &hellip;) or C shell-compatible (<literal>csh</literal>, <literal>tcsh</literal>)
command interpreter.  The latter read the <filename>.cshrc</filename> file for
initialization information, and the former read <filename>.profile</filename>.
</para>
<para>In a <filename>.cshrc</filename> file, you could use the following <literal>csh</literal> command
sequence:
</para>
<programlisting>
setenv TEXINPUTS .:/home/me/mylib:/usr/lib/tex/macros
</programlisting>


<para>In a <filename>.profile</filename> file, you could use the following <literal>sh</literal> command
sequence:
</para>
<programlisting>

TEXINPUTS=.:/home/me/mylib:/usr/lib/tex/macros
export TEXINPUTS

</programlisting>

<para>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows, you would say it like this<footnote><para>Note the use of the <literal>;</literal> character, instead of <literal>:</literal>, as directory separator on these systems.</para></footnote>:

<para>
It is customary for DOS/Windows users to put such commands in the

<para>Finally, you may wish to dump a <filename>.fmt</filename> file (see (web2c)) so that TeX can load Texinfo faster.  (The
disadvantage is that then updating <filename>texinfo.tex</filename> requires
redumping.)  You can do this by running this command, assuming
<filename>epsf.tex</filename> is findable by TeX:
</para>
<programlisting>
initex texinfo @dump
</programlisting>

<para>(<literal>dump</literal> is a TeX primitive.)  Then, move <filename>texinfo.fmt</filename> to
wherever your <literal>.fmt</literal> files are found; typically, this will be in the
subdirectory <filename>web2c</filename> of your TeX installation.

<indexterm><primary>Final output</primary></indexterm>

<para>TeX is sometimes unable to typeset a line without extending it into
the right margin.  This can occur when TeX comes upon what it
interprets as a long word that it cannot hyphenate, such as an
electronic mail network address or a very long title.  When this
happens, TeX prints an error message like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
Overfull @hbox (20.76302pt too wide)
</programlisting>

<indexterm><primary>hbox</primary></indexterm>
<para>
(In TeX, lines are in ``horizontal boxes'', hence the term, ``hbox''.
<literal>@hbox</literal> is a TeX primitive not needed in the Texinfo language.)
</para>
<para>TeX also provides the line number in the Texinfo source file and
the text of the offending line, which is marked at all the places that
TeX considered hyphenation.
See <link linkend='debugging-with-tex'>Catching Errors with TeX Formatting</link>,
for more information about typesetting errors.
</para>
<para>If the Texinfo file has an overfull hbox, you can rewrite the sentence
so the overfull hbox does not occur, or you can decide to leave it.  A
small excursion into the right margin often does not matter and may not
even be noticeable.
</para>
<para>If you have many overfull boxes and/or an antipathy to rewriting, you
can coerce TeX into greatly increasing the allowable interword
spacing, thus (if you're lucky) avoiding many of the bad line breaks,
like this:
</para>
<indexterm><primary>\emergencystretch</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>
@tex
\global\emergencystretch = .9\hsize
@end tex
</programlisting>

<para>
(You should adjust the fraction as needed.)  This huge value for
<literal>\emergencystretch</literal> cannot be the default, since then the typeset
output would generally be of noticeably lower quality; the default
is <literal>.15\hsize</literal>.  <literal>\hsize</literal> is the TeX dimension
containing the current line width.

<para>For what overfull boxes you have, however, TeX will print a large,
ugly, black rectangle beside the line that contains the overfull hbox
unless told otherwise.  This is so you will notice the location of the
problem if you are correcting a draft.

</para>
<programlisting>

<para>This command is mainly for printers that typeset several pages on one

book set to 7 by 9.25 inches with the <literal>@smallbook</literal> command.
(Printers will not produce cropmarks for regular sized output that is

<indexterm><primary>Larger or smaller pages</primary></indexterm>
<para>You can attempt to direct TeX to typeset pages larger or smaller than
usual with the <literal>\mag</literal> TeX command.  Everything that is typeset
is scaled proportionally larger or smaller.  (<literal>\mag</literal> stands for
``magnification''.)  This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a Texinfo @-command, but is a
plain TeX command that is prefixed with a backslash.  You have to
write this command between <literal>@tex</literal> and <literal>@end tex</literal>
(see <link linkend='raw-formatter-commands'>Raw Formatter Commands</link>).
</para>
<para>Follow the <literal>\mag</literal> command with an <literal>=</literal> and then a number that

at 1.2 normal size, write the following near the beginning of the
Texinfo file, before the title page:
</para>
<programlisting>

@tex
\mag=1200
@end tex

</programlisting>

<para>With some printing technologies, you can print normal-sized copies that
look better than usual by giving a larger-than-normal master to your
print shop.  They do the reduction, thus effectively increasing the
resolution.

<para><emphasis role='bold'>PDF</emphasis> stands for `Portable Document Format'. It was invented by

formats.
</para>
<para>Despite the `portable' in the name, PDF files are nowhere near as
portable in practice as the plain ASCII formats (Info, HTML) that
Texinfo supports (DVI portability is arguable).  They also tend to be
much larger and do not support the bitmap fonts used by TeX (by
default) very well.  Nevertheless, a PDF file does preserve an actual
printed document on a screen as faithfully as possible, so it has its place.

<para>The <literal>makeinfo</literal> command takes a number of options.  Most often,
options are used to set the value of the fill column and specify the
footnote style.  Each command line option is a word preceded by
<literal>--</literal> or a letter preceded by <literal>-</literal>.  You can use abbreviations
for the long option names as long as they are unique.
</para>
<para>For example, you could use the following shell command to create an Info

columns:
</para>
<programlisting>

<para>You can write two or more options in sequence, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
makeinfo --no-split --fill-column=70 &hellip;

<indexterm><primary>Pointer validation with <literal>makeinfo</literal></primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Validation of pointers</primary></indexterm>

<para>If you do not suppress pointer validation with the <literal>--no-validate</literal>
option or the <literal>@novalidate</literal> command in the source file (see <link linkend='use-tex'>Use TeX</link>), <literal>makeinfo</literal> will check the validity of the final
Info file.  Mostly, this means ensuring that nodes you have referenced
really exist.  Here is a complete list of what is checked:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>If a `Next', `Previous', or `Up' node reference is a reference to a
node in the current file and is not an external reference such as to
<filename>(dir)</filename>, then the referenced node must exist.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In every node, if the `Previous' node is different from the `Up' node,
then the node pointed to by the `Previous' field must have a `Next'
field which points back to this node.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Every node except the `Top' node must have an `Up' pointer.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The node referenced by an `Up' pointer must itself reference the current
node through a menu item, unless the node referenced by `Up'
has the form `(<literal>file</literal>)'.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the `Next' reference of a node is not the same as the `Next' reference
of the `Up' reference, then the node referenced by the `Next' pointer
must have a `Previous' pointer that points back to the current node.
This rule allows the last node in a section to point to the first node
of the next chapter.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Every node except `Top' should be referenced by at least one other node,
either via the `Previous' or `Next' links, or via a menu or a
cross-reference.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<indexterm><primary>DCM_AT-commands in DCM_ATnode, limited support</primary></indexterm>
<para>Some Texinfo documents might fail during the validation phase because
they use commands like <literal>@value</literal> and <literal>@definfoenclose</literal> in
node definitions and cross-references inconsistently.  Consider the
following example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@set nodename Node 1

@node @value{nodename}, Node 2, Top, Top

This is node 1.

@node Node 2, , Node 1, Top

This is node 2.

</programlisting>

<para>
Here, the node ``Node 1'' was referenced both verbatim and through
<literal>@value</literal>.
</para>
<para>By default, <literal>makeinfo</literal> fails such cases, because node names are not
fully expanded until they are written to the output file.  You should
always try to reference nodes consistently; e.g., in the above example,
the second <literal>@node</literal> line should have also used <literal>@value</literal>.
However, if, for some reason, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> reference node names
inconsistently, and <literal>makeinfo</literal> fails to validate the file, you can
use the <literal>--commands-in-node-names</literal> option to force <literal>makeinfo</literal>
to perform the expensive expansion of all node names it finds in the
document.  This might considerably slow down the program, though;
twofold increase in conversion time was measured for large documents
such as the Jargon file.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>DCM_ATvalue in DCM_ATnode lines</primary></indexterm>
<para>The support for <literal>@</literal>-commands in <literal>@node</literal> directives is not
general enough to be freely used.  For example, if the example above
redefined <literal>nodename</literal> somewhere in the document, <literal>makeinfo</literal>
will fail to convert it, even if invoked with the
<literal>--commands-in-node-names</literal> option.
</para>
<para><literal>--commands-in-node-names</literal> has no effect if the <literal>--no-validate</literal>
option is given.

<indexterm><primary>Tag table, making automatically</primary></indexterm>

<para>If a Texinfo file has more than 30,000 bytes,
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> automatically creates a tag table
for its Info file;  <literal>makeinfo</literal> always creates a tag table.  With
a <emphasis role='bold'>tag table</emphasis>, Info can jump to new nodes more quickly than it can
otherwise.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>Indirect subfiles</primary></indexterm>
<para>In addition, if the Texinfo file contains more than about 70,000
bytes, <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> and <literal>makeinfo</literal> split the
large Info file into shorter <emphasis role='bold'>indirect</emphasis> subfiles of about 50,000
bytes each.  Big files are split into smaller files so that Emacs does
not need to make a large buffer to hold the whole of a large Info
file; instead, Emacs allocates just enough memory for the small, split-off
file that is needed at the time.  This way, Emacs avoids wasting
memory when you run Info.  (Before splitting was implemented, Info
files were always kept short and <emphasis role='bold'>include files</emphasis> were designed as
a way to create a single, large printed manual out of the smaller Info
files.  See <link linkend='include-files'>Include Files</link>, for more information.  Include files are
still used for very large documents, such as <citetitle>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</citetitle>, in which each chapter is a separate file.)
</para>
<para>When a file is split, Info itself makes use of a shortened version of
the original file that contains just the tag table and references to
the files that were split off.  The split-off files are called
<emphasis role='bold'>indirect</emphasis> files.
</para>
<para>The split-off files have names that are created by appending <literal>-1</literal>,
<literal>-2</literal>, <literal>-3</literal> and so on to the file name specified by the
<literal>@setfilename</literal> command.  The shortened version of the original file
continues to have the name specified by <literal>@setfilename</literal>.
</para>
<para>At one stage in writing this document, for example, the Info file was saved
as the file <filename>test-texinfo</filename> and that file looked like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

the split-off, indirect files, <filename>test-texinfo-1</filename>,
<filename>test-texinfo-2</filename>, and <filename>test-texinfo-3</filename>, is listed in this file
after the line that says <literal>Indirect:</literal>.  The tag table is listed after
the line that says <literal>Tag table:</literal>. 
</para>
<para>In the list of indirect files, the number following the file name
records the cumulative number of bytes in the preceding indirect files,
not counting the file list itself, the tag table, or the permissions
text in each file.  In the tag table, the number following the node name
records the location of the beginning of the node, in bytes from the
beginning of the (unsplit) output.
</para>
<para>If you are using <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> to create Info files,
you may want to run the <literal>Info-validate</literal> command.  (The
<literal>makeinfo</literal> command does such a good job on its own, you do not

<indexterm><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>

<para>Besides generating output in the Info format, you can use the
<literal>--html</literal> option to generate output in HTML format, for installation
on a web site (for example).  By default, the HTML output is split at
node level.
</para>
<para>When splitting, the HTML output files are written into a subdirectory.
The subdirectory is named according to the name from
<literal>@setfilename</literal> with any extension removed; for example, HTML
output for <literal>@setfilename emacs.info</literal> would be written into a
subdirectory named <literal>emacs</literal>.  If that directory cannot be created
for any reason, then <literal>.html</literal> is appended to the directory name, as
in <literal>emacs.html</literal> (this is necessary because sometimes the info file
is named without an extension, e.g., <literal>texinfo</literal>).  If the
<literal>name.html</literal> directory can't be created either,
<literal>makeinfo</literal> gives up.  In any case, the top-level output file within
the directory is always named <literal>index.html</literal>.
</para>
<para>Monolithic output (<literal>--no-split</literal>) is named according to
<literal>@setfilename</literal> or <literal>--outfile</literal>.  Cross-document node
references are not supported in monolithic HTML.
</para>
<para>Texinfo input marked up with the <literal>@ifhtml</literal> command will produce
output only with the <literal>--html</literal> option supplied.  Input marked up
with the <literal>@html</literal> is passed literally to the output (suppressing
the normal escaping of input <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&gt;</literal> and <literal>&amp;</literal> characters
which have special significance in HTML).
</para>
<para>The <literal>--footnote-style</literal> option is currently ignored for HTML output;
footnotes are linked to the end of the output file.
</para>
<para>The HTML generated is mostly standard (i.e., HTML 2.0, RFC-1866).  The
exception is that HTML 3.2 tables are generated from the
<literal>@multitable</literal> command, but tagged to degrade as well as possible
in browsers without table support.  Please report output from an
error-free run of <literal>makeinfo</literal> which violates the HTML 3.2 DTD as
a bug.
</para>
<para>Navigation bars are inserted at the start of nodes, similarly to Info
output.  The <literal>--no-headers</literal> option will suppress this if used with
<literal>--no-split</literal>.  Header <literal>&lt;link&gt;</literal> elements in split output can
support info-like navigation with browsers like Lynx and Emacs W3
which implement this HTML 1.0 feature.  <literal>@xref</literal> commands to
other documents are generated assuming the other document is available
in split HTML form, and installed in the same HTML documentation tree,
at <filename>../&lt;info-document&gt;/</filename>.

</para>


<sect3 id='directory-file'><title id='directory-file-title'>The Directory File <filename>dir</filename></title>

<para>For Info to work, the <filename>info</filename> directory must contain a file that
serves as a top level directory for the Info system.  By convention,
this file is called <filename>dir</filename>.  (You can find the location of this file
within Emacs by typing <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>h</keycap></keycombo><keycap>i</keycap> to enter Info and then typing
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>f</keycap></keycombo> to see the pathname to the <filename>info</filename> directory.)
</para>
<para>The <filename>dir</filename> file is itself an Info file.  It contains the top level
menu for all the Info files in the system.  The menu looks like
this:
</para>
<programlisting>

* Menu:
* Info:    (info).     Documentation browsing system.
* Emacs:   (emacs).    The extensible, self-documenting
                       text editor.
* Texinfo: (texinfo).  With one source file, make
                       either a printed manual using
                       @TeX{} or an Info file.
&hellip;

</programlisting>

<para>Each of these menu entries points to the `Top' node of the Info file
that is named in parentheses.  (The menu entry does not need to
specify the `Top' node, since Info goes to the `Top' node if no node
name is mentioned.  See <link linkend='other-info-files'>Nodes in Other Info Files</link>.)
</para>
<para>Thus, the <literal>Info</literal> entry points to the `Top' node of the
<filename>info</filename> file and the <literal>Emacs</literal> entry points to the `Top' node
of the <filename>emacs</filename> file.
</para>
<para>In each of the Info files, the `Up' pointer of the `Top' node refers
back to the <literal>dir</literal> file.  For example, the line for the `Top'
node of the Emacs manual looks like this in Info:
</para>
<programlisting>
File: emacs  Node: Top, Up: (DIR), Next: Distrib
</programlisting>

<para>
In this case, the <filename>dir</filename> file name is written in upper case
letters---it can be written in either upper or lower case.  This is not
true in general, it is a special case for <filename>dir</filename>.

For example, if you were adding documentation for GDB, you would write
the following new entry:
</para>
<programlisting>
* GDB: (gdb).           The source-level C debugger.
</programlisting>

<para>
The first part of the menu entry is the menu entry name, followed by a
colon.  The second part is the name of the Info file, in parentheses,
followed by a period.  The third part is the description.
</para>
<para>The name of an Info file often has a <filename>.info</filename> extension.  Thus, the
Info file for GDB might be called either <filename>gdb</filename> or <filename>gdb.info</filename>.
The Info reader programs automatically try the file name both with and
without <filename>.info</filename><footnote><para>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, Info will try the <filename>.inf</filename> extension as well.</para></footnote>; so it is better to avoid
clutter and not to write <literal>.info</literal> explicitly in the menu entry.  For
example, the GDB menu entry should use just <literal>gdb</literal> for the file
name, not <literal>gdb.info</literal>.

<para>If an Info file is not in the <filename>info</filename> directory, there are three
ways to specify its location:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>Write the pathname in the <filename>dir</filename> file as the second part of the menu.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If you are using Emacs, list the name of the file in a second <filename>dir</filename>
file, in its directory; and then add the name of that directory to the
<literal>Info-directory-list</literal> variable in your personal or site
initialization file.
</para>
<para>This variable tells Emacs where to look for <filename>dir</filename> files (the files
must be named <filename>dir</filename>).  Emacs merges the files named <filename>dir</filename> from
each of the listed directories.  (In Emacs version 18, you can set the
<literal>Info-directory</literal> variable to the name of only one
directory.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Specify the Info directory name in the <literal>INFOPATH</literal> environment
variable in your <filename>.profile</filename> or <filename>.cshrc</filename> initialization file.
(Only you and others who set this environment variable will be able to
find Info files whose location is specified this way.)
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>For example, to reach a test file in the <filename>/home/bob/info</filename>
directory, you could add an entry like this to the menu in the
standard <filename>dir</filename> file:
</para>
<programlisting>
* Test: (/home/bob/info/info-test).  Bob's own test file.
</programlisting>

<para>
In this case, the absolute file name of the <filename>info-test</filename> file is
written as the second part of the menu entry.
</para>
<para>Alternatively, you could write the following in your <filename>.emacs</filename> file:
</para>
<programlisting>

(require 'info)
(setq Info-directory-list
  (cons (expand-file-name "/home/bob/info")
        Info-directory-list))

</programlisting>

<para>This tells Emacs to merge the system <filename>dir</filename> file with the <filename>dir</filename>
file in <filename>/home/bob/info</filename>.  Thus, Info will list the
<filename>/home/bob/info/info-test</filename> file as a menu entry in the
<filename>/home/bob/info/dir</filename> file.  Emacs does the merging only when
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>info</keycap> is first run, so if you want to set
<literal>Info-directory-list</literal> in an Emacs session where you've already run
<literal>info</literal>, you must <literal>(setq Info-dir-contents nil)</literal> to force Emacs
to recompose the <filename>dir</filename> file.
</para>
<para>Finally, you can tell Info where to look by setting the <literal>INFOPATH</literal>
environment variable in your shell startup file, such as <filename>.cshrc</filename>,
<filename>.profile</filename> or <filename>autoexec.bat</filename>.  If you use a Bourne-compatible
shell such as <literal>sh</literal> or <literal>bash</literal> for your shell command
interpreter, you set the <literal>INFOPATH</literal> environment variable in the
<filename>.profile</filename> initialization file; but if you use <literal>csh</literal> or
<literal>tcsh</literal>, you set the variable in the <filename>.cshrc</filename> initialization
file.  On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, you must set <literal>INFOPATH</literal> in
your <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> file or in the Registry.  Each type of shell
uses a different syntax.
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>In a <filename>.cshrc</filename> file, you could set the <literal>INFOPATH</literal>
variable as follows:
</para>
<programlisting>
setenv INFOPATH .:~/info:/usr/local/emacs/info
</programlisting>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In a <filename>.profile</filename> file, you would achieve the same effect by
writing:
</para>
<programlisting>
INFOPATH=.:$HOME/info:/usr/local/emacs/info
export INFOPATH
</programlisting>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In a <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> file, you write this command<footnote><para>Note the use of <literal>;</literal> as the directory separator, and a different syntax for using values of other environment variables.</para></footnote>:
</para>
<programlisting>
set INFOPATH=.;%HOME%/info;c:/usr/local/emacs/info
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The <literal>.</literal> indicates the current directory as usual.  Emacs uses the
<literal>INFOPATH</literal> environment variable to initialize the value of Emacs's
own <literal>Info-directory-list</literal> variable.  The stand-alone Info reader
merges any files named <filename>dir</filename> in any directory listed in the
<envar>INFOPATH</envar> variable into a single menu presented to you in the node
called <literal>(dir)Top</literal>.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>colon, last in <envar>INFOPATH</envar></primary></indexterm>
<para>However you set <envar>INFOPATH</envar>, if its last character is a
colon<footnote><para>On MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems, use semi-colon instead.</para></footnote>, this
is replaced by the default (compiled-in) path.  This gives you a way to
augment the default path with new directories without having to list all
the standard places.  For example (using <literal>sh</literal> syntax):
</para>
<programlisting>
INFOPATH=/local/info:
export INFOPATH
</programlisting>

<para>
will search <filename>/local/info</filename> first, then the standard directories.
Leading or doubled colons are not treated specially.
</para>
<indexterm><primary><filename>dir</filename> file, creating your own</primary></indexterm>
<para>When you create your own <filename>dir</filename> file for use with
<literal>Info-directory-list</literal> or <envar>INFOPATH</envar>, it's easiest to start by
copying an existing <filename>dir</filename> file and replace all the text after the
<literal>* Menu:</literal> with your desired entries.  That way, the punctuation and
special CTRL-_ characters that Info needs will be present.

<sect3 id='installing-dir-entries'><title id='installing-dir-entries-title'>Installing Info Directory Files</title>

<para>When you install an Info file onto your system, you can use the program
<literal>install-info</literal> to update the Info directory file <filename>dir</filename>.
Normally the makefile for the package runs <literal>install-info</literal>, just
after copying the Info file into its proper installed location.
</para>
<indexterm><primary>dircategory</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>direntry</primary></indexterm>
<para>In order for the Info file to work with <literal>install-info</literal>, you should
use the commands <literal>@dircategory</literal> and
<literal>@direntry</literal>&hellip;<literal>@end direntry</literal> in the Texinfo source
file.  Use <literal>@direntry</literal> to specify the menu entries to add to the
Info directory file, and use <literal>@dircategory</literal> to specify which part
of the Info directory to put it in.  Here is how these commands are used
in this manual:
</para>
<programlisting>
@dircategory Texinfo documentation system
@direntry
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. &hellip;
&hellip;
@end direntry
</programlisting>

<para>Here's what this produces in the Info file:
</para>
<programlisting>
INFO-DIR-SECTION Texinfo documentation system
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
* Texinfo: (texinfo).           The GNU documentation format.
* install-info: (texinfo)Invoking install-info. &hellip;
&hellip;
END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY
</programlisting>

<para>
The <literal>install-info</literal> program sees these lines in the Info file, and
that is how it knows what to do.
</para>
<para>Always use the <literal>@direntry</literal> and <literal>@dircategory</literal> commands near
the beginning of the Texinfo input, before the first <literal>@node</literal>
command.  If you use them later on in the input, <literal>install-info</literal>
will not notice them.
</para>
<para>If you use <literal>@dircategory</literal> more than once in the Texinfo source,
each usage specifies the `current' category; any subsequent
<literal>@direntry</literal> commands will add to that category.  
</para>
<para>Here are some recommended <literal>@dircategory</literal> categories:
</para>
<literallayout>
GNU packages
GNU programming tools
GNU programming documentation
GNU Emacs Lisp
GNU libraries
Linux
TeX
Individual utilities
</literallayout>

<para>The idea is to include the `Invoking' node for every program installed
by a package under `Individual utilities', and an entry for the manual
as a whole in the appropriate other category.

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Write many index entries, in different ways.
Readers like indices; they are helpful and convenient.
</para>
<para>Although it is easiest to write index entries as you write the body of
the text, some people prefer to write entries afterwards.  In either
case, write an entry before the paragraph to which it applies.  This
way, an index entry points to the first page of a paragraph that is
split across pages.
</para>
<para>Here are more hints we have found valuable:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Write each index entry differently, so each entry refers to a different
place in the document.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Write index entries only where a topic is discussed significantly.  For
example, it is not useful to index ``debugging information'' in a
chapter on reporting bugs.  Someone who wants to know about debugging
information will certainly not find it in that chapter.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Consistently capitalize the first word of every concept index entry,
or else consistently use lower case.  Terse entries often call for
lower case; longer entries for capitalization.  Whichever case
convention you use, please use one or the other consistently!  Mixing
the two styles looks bad.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Always capitalize or use upper case for those words in an index for
which this is proper, such as names of countries or acronyms.  Always
use the appropriate case for case-sensitive names, such as those in C or
Lisp.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Write the indexing commands that refer to a whole section immediately
after the section command, and write the indexing commands that refer to
a paragraph before that paragraph.
</para>
<para>In the example that follows, a blank line comes after the index
entry for ``Leaping'':
</para>
<programlisting>

@section The Dog and the Fox
@cindex Jumping, in general
@cindex Leaping

@cindex Dog, lazy, jumped over
@cindex Lazy dog jumped over
@cindex Fox, jumps over dog
@cindex Quick fox jumps over dog
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

</programlisting>

<para>
(Note that the example shows entries for the same concept that are
written in different ways---<literal>Lazy dog</literal>, and <literal>Dog, lazy</literal>---so
readers can look up the concept in different ways.)
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Insert a blank line between a sectioning command and the first following
sentence or paragraph, or between the indexing commands associated with
the sectioning command and the first following sentence or paragraph, as
shown in the tip on indexing.  Otherwise, a formatter may fold title and
paragraph together.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Always insert a blank line before an <literal>@table</literal> command and after an
<literal>@end table</literal> command; but never insert a blank line after an
<literal>@table</literal> command or before an <literal>@end table</literal> command.
</para>

<para>For example,
</para>
<programlisting>

Types of fox:

@table @samp
@item Quick
Jump over lazy dogs.



@item Brown
Also jump over lazy dogs.
@end table



@noindent
On the other hand, &hellip;

</programlisting>

<para>Insert blank lines before and after <literal>@itemize</literal> &hellip; <literal>@end itemize</literal> and <literal>@enumerate</literal> &hellip; <literal>@end enumerate</literal> in the
same way.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Complete phrases are easier to read than &hellip;
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Write entries in an itemized list as complete sentences; or at least, as
complete phrases.  Incomplete expressions &hellip; awkward &hellip; like
this.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Write the prefatory sentence or phrase for a multi-item list or table as
a complete expression.  Do not write ``You can set:''; instead, write
``You can set these variables:''.  The former expression sounds cut off.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Write the edition and version numbers and date in three places in every
manual:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>In the first <literal>@ifinfo</literal> section, for people reading the Texinfo file.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In the <literal>@titlepage</literal> section, for people reading the printed manual.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In the `Top' node, for people reading the Info file.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Also, it helps to write a note before the first <literal>@ifinfo</literal>
section to explain what you are doing.
</para>

<para>
For example:
</para>
<programlisting>

@c ===&gt; NOTE! &lt;==
@c Specify the edition and version numbers and date
@c in *three* places:
@c   1. First ifinfo section  2. title page  3. top node
@c To find the locations, search for !!set



@ifinfo
@c !!set edition, date, version
This is Edition 4.03, January 1992,
of the @cite{GDB Manual} for GDB Version 4.3.
&hellip;

</programlisting>

<para>
---or use <literal>@set</literal> and <literal>@value</literal>
(see <link linkend='value-example'><literal>@value</literal> Example</link>).
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Definition commands are <literal>@deffn</literal>, <literal>@defun</literal>,
<literal>@defmac</literal>, and the like, and enable you to write descriptions in
a uniform format.
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Write just one definition command for each entity you define with a
definition command.  The automatic indexing feature creates an index
entry that leads the reader to the definition.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Use <literal>@table</literal> &hellip; <literal>@end table</literal> in an appendix that
contains a summary of functions, not <literal>@deffn</literal> or other definition
commands.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Capitalize ``Texinfo''; it is a name.  Do not write the <literal>x</literal> or
<literal>i</literal> in upper case.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Capitalize ``Info''; it is a name.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Write TeX using the <literal>@TeX{}</literal> command.  Note the uppercase
<literal>T</literal> and <literal>X</literal>.  This command causes the formatters to
typeset the name according to the wishes of Donald Knuth, who wrote
TeX.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Do not use spaces to format a Texinfo file, except inside of
<literal>@example</literal> &hellip; <literal>@end example</literal> and similar commands.
</para>

<para>For example, TeX fills the following:
</para>
<programlisting>

    @kbd{C-x v}
    @kbd{M-x vc-next-action}
       Perform the next logical operation
       on the version-controlled file
       corresponding to the current buffer.

</programlisting>


<para>
so it looks like this:
</para>

<para>
In this case, the text should be formatted with
<literal>@table</literal>, <literal>@item</literal>, and <literal>@itemx</literal>, to create a table.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Use <literal>@code</literal> around Lisp symbols, including command names.
For example,
</para>
<programlisting>
The main function is @code{vc-next-action}, &hellip;
</programlisting>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Avoid putting letters such as <literal>s</literal> immediately after an
<literal>@code</literal>.  Such letters look bad.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Use <literal>@var</literal> around meta-variables.  Do not write angle brackets
around them.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Use three hyphens in a row, <literal>---</literal>, to indicate a long dash.  TeX
typesets these as a long dash and the Info formatters reduce three
hyphens to two.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Place periods and other punctuation marks <emphasis>outside</emphasis> of quotations,
unless the punctuation is part of the quotation.  This practice goes
against publishing conventions in the United States, but enables the
reader to distinguish between the contents of the quotation and the
whole passage.
</para>
<para>For example, you should write the following sentence with the period
outside the end quotation marks:
</para>
<programlisting>
Evidently, au is an abbreviation for ``author''.
</programlisting>

<para>
since <literal>au</literal> does <emphasis>not</emphasis> serve as an  abbreviation for
<literal>author.</literal> (with a period following the word).
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Introduce new terms so that a reader who does not know them can
understand them from context; or write a definition for the term.
</para>
<para>For example, in the following, the terms ``check in'', ``register'' and
``delta'' are all appearing for the first time; the example sentence should be
rewritten so they are understandable.
</para>
<blockquote><para>The major function assists you in checking in a file to your
version control system and registering successive sets of changes to
it as deltas.
</para></blockquote>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Use the <literal>@dfn</literal> command around a word being introduced, to indicate
that the reader should not expect to know the meaning already, and
should expect to learn the meaning from this passage.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<!--  !!! maybe include this in the tips on pxref -->

<para>Absolutely never use <literal>@pxref</literal> except in the special context for
which it is designed: inside parentheses, with the closing parenthesis
following immediately after the closing brace.  One formatter
automatically inserts closing punctuation and the other does not.  This
means that the output looks right both in printed output and in an Info
file, but only when the command is used inside parentheses.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>You can invoke programs such as Emacs, GCC, and <literal>gawk</literal> from a
shell.  The documentation for each program should contain a section that
describes this.  Unfortunately, if the node names and titles for these
sections are all different, they are difficult for users to find.
</para>
<para>So, there is a convention to name such sections with a phrase beginning
with the word `Invoking', as in `Invoking Emacs'; this way, users can
find the section easily.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>When you use <literal>@example</literal> to describe a C function's calling
conventions, use the ANSI C syntax, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
void dld_init (char *@var{path});
</programlisting>

<para>
And in the subsequent discussion, refer to the argument values by
writing the same argument names, again highlighted with
<literal>@var</literal>.
</para>

<para>Avoid the obsolete style that looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
#include &lt;dld.h&gt;

dld_init (path)
char *path;
</programlisting>

<para>Also, it is best to avoid writing <literal>#include</literal> above the
declaration just to indicate that the function is declared in a
header file.  The practice may give the misimpression that the
<literal>#include</literal> belongs near the declaration of the function.  Either
state explicitly which header file holds the declaration or, better
yet, name the header file used for a group of functions at the
beginning of the section that describes the functions.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>Here are several examples of bad writing to avoid:
</para>
<para>In this example, say, `` &hellip; you must <literal>@dfn</literal>{check
in} the new version.''  That flows better.
</para>
<blockquote><para>When you are done editing the file, you must perform a
<literal>@dfn</literal>{check in}.
</para></blockquote>
<para>In the following example, say, ``&hellip; makes a unified interface such as VC
mode possible.''
</para>
<blockquote><para>SCCS, RCS and other version-control systems all perform similar
functions in broadly similar ways (it is this resemblance which makes
a unified control mode like this possible).
</para></blockquote>
<para>And in this example, you should specify what `it' refers to:
</para>
<blockquote><para>If you are working with other people, it assists in coordinating
everyone's changes so they do not step on each other.
</para></blockquote>
</sect3>

<sect3><title></title>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>Pronounce TeX as if the <literal>X</literal> were a Greek `chi', as the last
sound in the name `Bach'.  But pronounce Texinfo as in `speck':
``teckinfo''.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Write notes for yourself at the very end of a Texinfo file after the
<literal>@bye</literal>.  None of the formatters process text after the
<literal>@bye</literal>; it is as if the text were within <literal>@ignore</literal> &hellip;
<literal>@end ignore</literal>.

<appendix id='include-files'><title id='include-files-title'>Include Files</title>
<indexterm><primary>Include files</primary></indexterm>

<para>When TeX or an Info formatting command sees an <literal>@include</literal>
command in a Texinfo file, it processes the contents of the file named
by the command and incorporates them into the DVI or Info file being
created.  Index entries from the included file are incorporated into
the indices of the output file.
</para>
<para>Include files let you keep a single large document as a collection of
conveniently small parts.
</para>

<sect1 id='using-include-files'><title id='using-include-files-title'>How to Use Include Files</title>
<indexterm><primary>include</primary></indexterm>

<para>To include another file within a Texinfo file, write the
<literal>@include</literal> command at the beginning of a line and follow it on
the same line by the name of a file to be included.  For
example:
</para>
<programlisting>
@include buffers.texi
</programlisting>

<para>An included file should simply be a segment of text that you expect to
be included as is into the overall or <emphasis role='bold'>outer</emphasis> Texinfo file; it
should not contain the standard beginning and end parts of a Texinfo
file.  In particular, you should not start an included file with a
line saying <literal>\input texinfo</literal>; if you do, that phrase is inserted
into the output file as is.  Likewise, you should not end an included
file with an <literal>@bye</literal> command; nothing after <literal>@bye</literal> is
formatted.
</para>
<para>In the past, you were required to write an <literal>@setfilename</literal> line at the
beginning of an included file, but no longer.  Now, it does not matter
whether you write such a line.  If an <literal>@setfilename</literal> line exists
in an included file, it is ignored.
</para>
<para>Conventionally, an included file begins with an <literal>@node</literal> line that
is followed by an <literal>@chapter</literal> line.  Each included file is one
chapter.  This makes it easy to use the regular node and menu creating
and updating commands to create the node pointers and menus within the
included file.  However, the simple Emacs node and menu creating and
updating commands do not work with multiple Texinfo files.  Thus you
cannot use these commands to fill in the `Next', `Previous', and `Up'
pointers of the <literal>@node</literal> line that begins the included file.  Also,
you cannot use the regular commands to create a master menu for the
whole file.  Either you must insert the menus and the `Next',
`Previous', and `Up' pointers by hand, or you must use the GNU Emacs
Texinfo mode command, <literal>texinfo-multiple-files-update</literal>, that is
designed for <literal>@include</literal> files.

<para>If you plan to use the <literal>texinfo-multiple-files-update</literal> command,
the outer Texinfo file that lists included files within it should
contain nothing but the beginning and end parts of a Texinfo file, and
a number of <literal>@include</literal> commands listing the included files.  It
should not even include indices, which should be listed in an included

</para>
<para>Moreover, each of the included files must contain exactly one highest
level node (conventionally, <literal>@chapter</literal> or equivalent),
and this node must be the first node in the included file.
Furthermore, each of these highest level nodes in each included file
must be at the same hierarchical level in the file structure.
Usually, each is an <literal>@chapter</literal>, an <literal>@appendix</literal>, or an

<para>The outer Texinfo source file for <citetitle>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</citetitle> is named <filename>elisp.texi</filename>.  This outer file contains a master
menu with 417 entries and a list of 41 <literal>@include</literal>
files.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id='include-files-evolution'><title id='include-files-evolution-title'>Evolution of Include Files</title>

<para>When Info was first created, it was customary to create many small
Info files on one subject.  Each Info file was formatted from its own
Texinfo source file.  This custom meant that Emacs did not need to
make a large buffer to hold the whole of a large Info file when
someone wanted information; instead, Emacs allocated just enough
memory for the small Info file that contained the particular
information sought.  This way, Emacs could avoid wasting memory.
</para>
<para>References from one file to another were made by referring to the file
name as well as the node name. (See <link linkend='other-info-files'>Referring to Other Info Files</link>.  Also, see <link linkend='four-and-five-arguments'><literal>@xref</literal> with Four and Five Arguments</link>.)
</para>
<para>Include files were designed primarily as a way to create a single,
large printed manual out of several smaller Info files.  In a printed
manual, all the references were within the same document, so TeX
could automatically determine the references' page numbers.  The Info
formatting commands used include files only for creating joint
indices; each of the individual Texinfo files had to be formatted for
Info individually.  (Each, therefore, required its own
<literal>@setfilename</literal> line.)
</para>
<para>However, because large Info files are now split automatically, it is
no longer necessary to keep them small.
</para>
<para>Nowadays, multiple Texinfo files are used mostly for large documents,
such as <citetitle>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</citetitle>, and for projects
in which several different people write different sections of a
document simultaneously.
</para>
<para>In addition, the Info formatting commands have been extended to work
with the <literal>@include</literal> command so as to create a single large Info
file that is split into smaller files if necessary.  This means that
you can write menus and cross references without naming the different
Texinfo files.

<para>Most printed manuals contain headings along the top of every page
except the title and copyright pages.  Some manuals also contain
footings.  (Headings and footings have no meaning to Info, which is
not paginated.)
</para>


</appendix>
<sect1 id='headings-introduced'><title id='headings-introduced-title'>Headings Introduced</title>
<para>Texinfo provides standard page heading formats for manuals that are
printed on one side of each sheet of paper and for manuals that are
printed on both sides of the paper.  Typically, you will use these
formats, but you can specify your own format if you wish.
</para>
<para>In addition, you can specify whether chapters should begin on a new
page, or merely continue the same page as the previous chapter; and if
chapters begin on new pages, you can specify whether they must be
odd-numbered pages.
</para>
<para>By convention, a book is printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.
When you open a book, the right-hand page is odd-numbered, and
chapters begin on right-hand pages---a preceding left-hand page is
left blank if necessary.  Reports, however, are often printed on just
one side of paper, and chapters begin on a fresh page immediately
following the end of the preceding chapter.  In short or informal
reports, chapters often do not begin on a new page at all, but are
separated from the preceding text by a small amount of whitespace.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command controls whether chapters begin
on new pages, and whether one of the standard heading formats is used.
In addition, Texinfo has several heading and footing commands that you
can use to generate your own heading and footing formats.
</para>
<para>In Texinfo, headings and footings are single lines at the tops and
bottoms of pages; you cannot create multiline headings or footings.
Each header or footer line is divided into three parts: a left part, a
middle part, and a right part.  Any part, or a whole line, may be left
blank.  Text for the left part of a header or footer line is set
flushleft; text for the middle part is centered; and, text for the
right part is set flushright.

<sect2 id='heading-format'><title id='heading-format-title'>Standard Heading Formats</title>

<para>Texinfo provides two standard heading formats, one for manuals printed
on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other for manuals printed
on both sides of the paper.
</para>
<para>By default, nothing is specified for the footing of a Texinfo file,
so the footing remains blank.
</para>
<para>The standard format for single-sided printing consists of a header
line in which the left-hand part contains the name of the chapter, the
central part is blank, and the right-hand part contains the page
number.
</para>

<para>A single-sided page looks like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

   _______________________
  |                       |
  | chapter   page number |
  |                       |
  | Start of text ...     |
  | ...                   |
  |                       |


</programlisting>

<para>The standard format for two-sided printing depends on whether the page
number is even or odd.  By convention, even-numbered pages are on the
left- and odd-numbered pages are on the right.  (TeX will adjust the
widths of the left- and right-hand margins.  Usually, widths are
correct, but during double-sided printing, it is wise to check that
pages will bind properly---sometimes a printer will produce output in
which the even-numbered pages have a larger right-hand margin than the
odd-numbered pages.)
</para>
<para>In the standard double-sided format, the left part of the left-hand
(even-numbered) page contains the page number, the central part is
blank, and the right part contains the title (specified by the
<literal>@settitle</literal> command).  The left part of the right-hand
(odd-numbered) page contains the name of the chapter, the central part
is blank, and the right part contains the page number.
</para>

<para>Two pages, side by side as in an open book, look like this:

<para>TeX does not begin to generate page headings for a standard Texinfo
file until it reaches the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command.  Thus, the
title and copyright pages are not numbered.  The <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command causes TeX to begin to generate page headings
according to a standard format specified by the
<literal>@setchapternewpage</literal> command that precedes the

</sect2>

<sect2 id='custom-headings'><title id='custom-headings-title'>How to Make Your Own Headings</title>

<para>You can use the standard headings provided with Texinfo or specify
your own.  By default, Texinfo has no footers, so if you specify them,
the available page size for the main text will be slightly reduced.
</para>
<para>Texinfo provides six commands for specifying headings and
footings:
</para><itemizedlist><listitem>
<para><literal>@everyheading</literal> <literal>@everyfooting</literal> generate page headers and
footers that are the same for both even- and odd-numbered pages.
</para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>@evenheading</literal> and <literal>@evenfooting</literal> command generate headers
and footers for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.
</para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para><literal>@oddheading</literal> and <literal>@oddfooting</literal> generate headers and footers
for odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Write custom heading specifications in the Texinfo file immediately
after the <literal>@end titlepage</literal> command.  Enclose your specifications
between <literal>@iftex</literal> and <literal>@end iftex</literal> commands since the
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> command may not recognize them.  Also,
you must cancel the predefined heading commands with the
<literal>@headings off</literal> command before defining your own
specifications.
</para>

<para>Here is how to tell TeX to place the chapter name at the left, the
page number in the center, and the date at the right of every header
for both even- and odd-numbered pages:
</para>
<programlisting>

@iftex
@headings off
@everyheading @thischapter @| @thispage @| @today{}
@end iftex

</programlisting>

<para>
You need to divide the left part from the central part and the central
part from the right part by inserting <literal>@|</literal> between parts.
Otherwise, the specification command will not be able to tell where
the text for one part ends and the next part begins.
</para>
<para>Each part can contain text or @-commands.  The text
is printed as if the part were within an ordinary paragraph in the
body of the page.  The @-commands replace
themselves with the page number, date, chapter name, or
whatever.
</para>

<para>Here are the six heading and footing commands:
</para>
<indexterm><primary>everyheading</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>everyfooting</primary></indexterm>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry><literal>@everyheading left @| center @| right</literal>
, <literal>@everyfooting left @| center @| right</literal>
</entry>
<entry>
The `every' commands specify the format for both even- and odd-numbered
pages.  These commands are for documents that are printed on one side
of each sheet of paper, or for documents in which you want symmetrical
headers or footers.

<indexterm><primary>evenheading</primary></indexterm>

The `even' and `odd' commands specify the format for even-numbered
pages and odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for books and
manuals that are printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.
</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<para>Use the <literal>@this&hellip;</literal> series of @-commands to
provide the names of chapters
and sections and the page number.  You can use the
<literal>@this&hellip;</literal> commands in the left, center, or right portions
of headers and footers, or anywhere else in a Texinfo file so long as
they are between <literal>@iftex</literal> and <literal>@end iftex</literal> commands.

<para>
You can also use the <literal>@today{}</literal> command, which expands to the
current date, in `1 Jan 1900' format.
<indexterm><primary>today</primary></indexterm>
</para>
<para>Other @-commands and text are printed in a header or footer just as
if they were in the body of a page.  It is useful to incorporate text,
particularly when you are writing drafts:
</para>
<programlisting>

@iftex
@headings off
@everyheading @emph{Draft!} @| @thispage @| @thischapter
@everyfooting @| @| Version: 0.27: @today{}

<sect1 id='makeinfo-preferred'><title id='makeinfo-preferred-title'>makeinfo Preferred</title>
<para>The <literal>makeinfo</literal> program does an excellent job of catching errors

automatically creating and updating node pointers and menus remove
many opportunities for human error.
</para>
<para>If you can, use the updating commands to create and insert pointers

its Texinfo mode manifestations, <literal>makeinfo-region</literal> and
<literal>makeinfo-buffer</literal>) to format your file and check for other

<indexterm><primary>Catching errors with Info formatting</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Debugging with Info formatting</primary></indexterm>

<para>After you have written part of a Texinfo file, you can use the
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> or the <literal>makeinfo-region</literal> command to
see whether the region formats properly.
</para>
<para>Most likely, however, you are reading this section because for some
reason you cannot use the <literal>makeinfo-region</literal> command; therefore, the
rest of this section presumes that you are using
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal>.
</para>
<para>If you have made a mistake with an @-command,
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> will stop processing at or after the
error and display an error message.  To see where in the buffer the
error occurred, switch to the <literal>*Info Region*</literal> buffer; the cursor
will be in a position that is after the location of the error.  Also,
the text will not be formatted after the place where the error
occurred (or more precisely, where it was detected).
</para>
<para>For example, if you accidentally end a menu with the command <literal>@end menus</literal> with an `s' on the end, instead of with <literal>@end menu</literal>, you
will see an error message that says:
</para>
<programlisting>
@end menus is not handled by texinfo
</programlisting>

<para>
The cursor will stop at the point in the buffer where the error
occurs, or not long after it.  The buffer will look like this:
</para>
<programlisting>

---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
* Menu:

* Using texinfo-show-structure::  How to use
                                  `texinfo-show-structure'

---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------

</programlisting>

<para>The <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> command sometimes provides slightly
odd error messages.  For example, the following cross reference fails to format:
</para>
<programlisting>
(@xref{Catching Mistakes, for more info.)
</programlisting>

<para>
In this case, <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> detects the missing closing
brace but displays a message that says <literal>Unbalanced parentheses</literal>
rather than <literal>Unbalanced braces</literal>.  This is because the formatting
command looks for mismatches between braces as if they were
parentheses.
</para>
<para>Sometimes <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> fails to detect mistakes.  For
example, in the following, the closing brace is swapped with the
closing parenthesis:
</para>
<programlisting>
(@xref{Catching Mistakes), for more info.}
</programlisting>

<para>
Formatting produces:
<programlisting>
(*Note for more info.: Catching Mistakes)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>The only way for you to detect this error is to realize that the
reference should have looked like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
(*Note Catching Mistakes::, for more info.)
</programlisting>

<para>Incidentally, if you are reading this node in Info and type <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>f</keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo> (<literal>Info-follow-reference</literal>), you will generate an error
message that says:
</para>
<programlisting>
No such node: "Catching Mistakes) The only way &hellip;
</programlisting>

<para>
This is because Info perceives the example of the error as the first
cross reference in this node and if you type a <keycap>RET</keycap> immediately
after typing the Info <keycap>f</keycap> command, Info will attempt to go to the
referenced node.  If you type <keycap>f</keycap><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>catch</keycap><keycap>TAB</keycap><keycap></keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo>, Info
will complete the node name of the correctly written example and take
you to the `Catching Mistakes' node.  (If you try this, you can return
from the `Catching Mistakes' node by typing <keycap>l</keycap>
(<literal>Info-last</literal>).)

</para>
<para>Usually, you will want to do this after you have run
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> (or, better, <literal>makeinfo-buffer</literal>) on
the same file, because <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> sometimes displays
error messages that make more sense than TeX.  (See <link linkend='debugging-with-info'>Debugging with Info</link>, for more information.)
</para>
<para>For example, TeX was run on a Texinfo file, part of which is shown
here:

circumstance.
</para>
<para>Unfortunately, TeX is not always so helpful, and sometimes you must
truly be a Sherlock Holmes to discover what went wrong.

<para>In any case, if you run into a problem like this, you can do one of three
things.
</para>

<para>You can tell TeX to continue running and ignore just this error by

<para>You can tell TeX to continue running and to ignore all errors as best
it can by typing <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>r</keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo> at the <literal>?</literal> prompt.
</para>
<para>This is often the best thing to do.  However, beware: the one error
may produce a cascade of additional error messages as its consequences
are felt through the rest of the file.  To stop TeX when it is
producing such an avalanche of error messages, type <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo> (or
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo>, if you are running a shell inside Emacs).

</orderedlist>

<para>If you are running TeX inside Emacs, you need to switch to the shell
buffer and line at which TeX offers the <literal>?</literal> prompt.
</para>
<para>Sometimes TeX will format a file without producing error messages even
though there is a problem.  This usually occurs if a command is not ended
but TeX is able to continue processing anyhow.  For example, if you fail
to end an itemized list with the <literal>@end itemize</literal> command, TeX will
write a DVI file that you can print out.  The only error message that
TeX will give you is the somewhat mysterious comment that
</para>
<programlisting>
(@end occurred inside a group at level 1)
</programlisting>

<para>
However, if you print the DVI file, you will find that the text
of the file that follows the itemized list is entirely indented as if
it were part of the last item in the itemized list.  The error message
is the way TeX says that it expected to find an <literal>@end</literal>
command somewhere in the file; but that it could not determine where
it was needed.
</para>
<para>Another source of notoriously hard-to-find errors is a missing
<literal>@end group</literal> command.  If you ever are stumped by
incomprehensible errors, look for a missing <literal>@end group</literal> command
first.
</para>
<para>If the Texinfo file lacks header lines,
TeX may stop in the
beginning of its run and display output that looks like the following.
The <literal>*</literal> indicates that TeX is waiting for input.
</para>
<programlisting>
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.0)
(test.texinfo [1])

</programlisting>

<para>
In this case, simply type <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>\end</keycap><keycap>RET</keycap></keycombo> after the asterisk.  Then
write the header lines in the Texinfo file and run the TeX command
again. (Note the use of the backslash, <literal>\</literal>.  TeX uses <literal>\</literal>
instead of <literal>@</literal>; and in this circumstance, you are working
directly with TeX, not with Texinfo.)

<para>It is not always easy to keep track of the nodes, chapters, sections, and
subsections of a Texinfo file.  This is especially true if you are revising
or adding to a Texinfo file that someone else has written.
</para>
<para>In GNU Emacs, in Texinfo mode, the <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal>
command lists all the lines that begin with the @-commands that
specify the structure: <literal>@chapter</literal>, <literal>@section</literal>,
<literal>@appendix</literal>, and so on.  With an argument (<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u</keycap></keycombo>
as prefix argument, if interactive),
the command also shows the <literal>@node</literal> lines.  The
<literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> command is bound to <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>s</keycap></keycombo> in
Texinfo mode, by default.
</para>
<para>The lines are displayed in a buffer called the <literal>*Occur*</literal> buffer,
indented by hierarchical level.  For example, here is a part of what was
produced by running <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> on this manual:

</programlisting>

<para>This says that lines 4337, 4393, and 4417 of <filename>texinfo.texi</filename> begin
with the <literal>@section</literal>, <literal>@subheading</literal>, and <literal>@subsection</literal>
commands respectively.  If you move your cursor into the <literal>*Occur*</literal>
window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and use the
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo> command (<literal>occur-mode-goto-occurrence</literal>), to jump to
the corresponding spot in the Texinfo file.  See Using Occur: (emacs), for more
information about <literal>occur-mode-goto-occurrence</literal>.
</para>
<para>The first line in the <literal>*Occur*</literal> window describes the <emphasis role='bold'>regular expression</emphasis> specified by <literal>texinfo-heading-pattern</literal>.  This regular
expression is the pattern that <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> looks for.
See Using Regular Expressions: (emacs),
for more information.
</para>
<para>When you invoke the <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> command, Emacs will
display the structure of the whole buffer.  If you want to see the
structure of just a part of the buffer, of one chapter, for example,
use the <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>n</keycap><keycap>n</keycap> (<literal>narrow-to-region</literal>) command to mark the
region.  (See (emacs).)  This is
how the example used above was generated.  (To see the whole buffer
again, use <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>n</keycap><keycap>w</keycap> (<literal>widen</literal>).)
</para>
<para>If you call <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> with a prefix argument by
typing <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>u</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>C</keycap><keycap>s</keycap></keycombo>, it will list lines beginning with
<literal>@node</literal> as well as the lines beginning with the @-sign commands
for <literal>@chapter</literal>, <literal>@section</literal>, and the like.
</para>
<para>You can remind yourself of the structure of a Texinfo file by looking at
the list in the <literal>*Occur*</literal> window; and if you have mis-named a node
or left out a section, you can correct the mistake.

<para>Sometimes the <literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal> command produces too much
information.  Perhaps you want to remind yourself of the overall structure
of a Texinfo file, and are overwhelmed by the detailed list produced by
<literal>texinfo-show-structure</literal>.  In this case, you can use the <literal>occur</literal>
command directly.  To do this, type
</para>
<programlisting>
<keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycap>occur</keycap>
</programlisting>

<para>
and then, when prompted, type a <emphasis role='bold'>regexp</emphasis>, a regular expression for
the pattern you want to match.  (See Regular Expressions: (emacs).)  The <literal>occur</literal> command works from
the current location of the cursor in the buffer to the end of the
buffer.  If you want to run <literal>occur</literal> on the whole buffer, place
the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.
</para>
<para>For example, to see all the lines that contain the word
<literal>@chapter</literal> in them, just type <literal>@chapter</literal>.  This will
produce a list of the chapters.  It will also list all the sentences
with <literal>@chapter</literal> in the middle of the line.
</para>
<para>If you want to see only those lines that start with the word
<literal>@chapter</literal>, type <literal>^@chapter</literal> when prompted by
<literal>occur</literal>.  If you want to see all the lines that end with a word
or phrase, end the last word with a <literal>$</literal>; for example,
<literal>catching mistakes$</literal>.  This can be helpful when you want to see
all the nodes that are part of the same chapter or section and
therefore have the same `Up' pointer.

</para>
<para>The <literal>makeinfo</literal> program validates pointers automatically, so you

</para>
<para>If your file is valid, you will receive a message that says ``File appears
valid''.  However, if you have a pointer that does not point to a node,
error messages will be displayed in a buffer called <literal>*problems in info file*</literal>.
</para>
<para>For example, <literal>Info-validate</literal> was run on a test file that contained
only the first node of this manual.  One of the messages said:
</para>
<programlisting>
In node "Overview", invalid Next: Texinfo Mode
</programlisting>

<para>
This meant that the node called <literal>Overview</literal> had a `Next' pointer that
did not point to anything (which was true in this case, since the test file
had only one node in it).
</para>
<para>Now suppose we add a node named <literal>Texinfo Mode</literal> to our test case
but we do not specify a `Previous' for this node.  Then we will get
the following error message:
</para>
<programlisting>
In node "Texinfo Mode", should have Previous: Overview
</programlisting>

<para>
This is because every `Next' pointer should be matched by a
`Previous' (in the node where the `Next' points) which points back.
</para>
<para><literal>Info-validate</literal> also checks that all menu entries and cross references
point to actual nodes.
</para>
<para><literal>Info-validate</literal> requires a tag table and does not work with files
that have been split.  (The <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> command
automatically splits large files.)  In order to use <literal>Info-validate</literal>
on a large file, you must run <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> with an
argument so that it does not split the Info file; and you must create a
tag table for the unsplit file.

<para>You can run <literal>Info-validate</literal> only on a single Info file that has a
tag table.  The command will not work on the indirect subfiles that
are generated when a master file is split.  If you have a large file
(longer than 70,000 bytes or so), you need to run the
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> or <literal>makeinfo-buffer</literal> command in such
a way that it does not create indirect subfiles.  You will also need
to create a tag table for the Info file.  After you have done this,
you can run <literal>Info-validate</literal> and look for badly referenced
nodes.
</para>
<para>The first step is to create an unsplit Info file.  To prevent
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> from splitting a Texinfo file into
smaller Info files, give a prefix to the <keycombo action='simul'><keycap>M</keycap><keycap>x</keycap></keycombo><keycombo action='simul'><keycap>texinfo</keycap><keycap>format</keycap><keycap>buffer</keycap></keycombo> command:

<sect3 id='tagifying'><title id='tagifying-title'>Tagifying a File</title>

<para>After creating an unsplit Info file, you must create a tag table for

</para>
<programlisting>
M-x Info-tagify
</programlisting>

<para>
(Note the upper case <literal>I</literal> in <literal>Info-tagify</literal>.)  This creates an
Info file with a tag table that you can validate.

<para>The third step is to validate the Info file:
</para>
<programlisting>
M-x Info-validate

<para>

In brief, the steps are:

M-x Info-tagify
M-x Info-validate

</programlisting>

<para>After you have validated the node structure, you can rerun

<para>You should split a large file or else let the

<para>The split-off files are called the indirect subfiles.
</para>
<para>Info files are split to save memory.  With smaller files, Emacs does not
have make such a large buffer to hold the information.
</para>
<para>If an Info file has more than 30 nodes, you should also make a tag
table for it. See <link linkend='using-info-dash-validate'>Using Info-validate</link>, for information
about creating a tag table.  (Again, tag tables are usually created
automatically by the formatting command; you only need to create a tag
table yourself if you are doing the job manually.  Most likely, you
will do this for a large, unsplit file on which you have run
<literal>Info-validate</literal>.)
</para>
<!--  Info-split is autoloaded in `loaddefs.el' in Emacs 18.51 -->


<para>Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and split and type the two

<para>
(Note that the <literal>I</literal> in <literal>Info</literal> is upper case.)
</para>
<para>When you use the <literal>Info-split</literal> command, the buffer is modified into a
(small) Info file which lists the indirect subfiles.  This file should be
saved in place of the original visited file.  The indirect subfiles are
written in the same directory the original file is in, with names generated
by appending <literal>-</literal> and a number to the original file name.

<para>The <literal>@refill</literal> command refills and, optionally, indents the first
line of a paragraph.<footnote><para>Perhaps the command should have been called the <literal>@refillandindent</literal> command, but <literal>@refill</literal> is shorter and the name was chosen before indenting was possible.</para></footnote> The
<literal>@refill</literal> command is no longer important, but we describe it here
because you once needed it.  You will see it in many old Texinfo
files.
</para>
<para>Without refilling, paragraphs containing long @-constructs may look
bad after formatting because the formatter removes @-commands and
shortens some lines more than others.  In the past, neither the
<literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> command nor the
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> command refilled paragraphs
automatically.  The <literal>@refill</literal> command had to be written at the
end of every paragraph to cause these formatters to fill them.  (Both
TeX and <literal>makeinfo</literal> have always refilled paragraphs
automatically.)  Now, all the Info formatters automatically fill and
indent those paragraphs that need to be filled and indented.
</para>
<para>The <literal>@refill</literal> command causes <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> and
<literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal> to refill a paragraph in the Info file
<emphasis>after</emphasis> all the other processing has been done.  For this reason,
you can not use <literal>@refill</literal> with a paragraph containing either
<literal>@*</literal> or <literal>@w{ &hellip; }</literal> since the refilling action will
override those two commands.
</para>
<para>The <literal>texinfo-format-region</literal> and <literal>texinfo-format-buffer</literal>
commands now automatically append <literal>@refill</literal> to the end of each
paragraph that should be filled.  They do not append <literal>@refill</literal> to
the ends of paragraphs that contain <literal>@*</literal> or <literal>@w{ &hellip;}</literal>
and therefore do not refill or indent them.

<para>The character <literal>@</literal> is used to start special Texinfo commands.
(It has the same meaning that <literal>\</literal> has in plain TeX.)  Texinfo
has four types of @-command:
</para>
<informaltable><tgroup cols='2'><tbody>
<row><entry>1. Non-alphabetic commands.
</entry>
<entry>These commands consist of an @ followed by a punctuation mark or other
character that is not part of the alphabet.  Non-alphabetic commands are
almost always part of the text within a paragraph, and never take any
argument.  The two characters (@ and the other one) are complete in
themselves; none is followed by braces.  The non-alphabetic commands
are: <literal>@.</literal>, <literal>@:</literal>, <literal>@*</literal>, <literal>@<keycap>SPACE</keycap></literal>,
<literal>@<keycap>TAB</keycap></literal>, <literal>@<keycap>NL</keycap></literal>, <literal>@@</literal>, <literal>@{</literal>, and
<literal>@}</literal>.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry>2. Alphabetic commands that do not require arguments.
</entry>
<entry>These commands start with @ followed by a word followed by left- and
right-hand braces.  These commands insert special symbols in the
document; they do not require arguments.  For example,
<literal>@dots{}</literal> =&gt; <literal>&hellip;</literal>, <literal>@equiv{}</literal>
=&gt; <literal>&equiv;</literal>, <literal>@TeX{}</literal> =&gt; `TeX',
and <literal>@bullet{}</literal> =&gt; <literal>*</literal>.

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry>3. Alphabetic commands that require arguments within braces.
</entry>
<entry>These commands start with @ followed by a letter or a word, followed by an
argument within braces.  For example, the command <literal>@dfn</literal> indicates
the introductory or defining use of a term; it is used as follows: <literal>In Texinfo, @@-commands are @dfn{mark-up} commands.</literal>

</entry>
</row>
<row><entry>4. Alphabetic commands that occupy an entire line.
</entry>
<entry>These commands occupy an entire line.  The line starts with @,
followed by the name of the command (a word); for example, <literal>@center</literal>
or <literal>@cindex</literal>.  If no argument is needed, the word is followed by
the end of the line.  If there is an argument, it is separated from
the command name by a space.  Braces are not used.
</entry>
</row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

<indexterm><primary>Braces and argument syntax</primary></indexterm>
<para>Thus, the alphabetic commands fall into classes that have
different argument syntaxes.  You cannot tell to which class a command
belongs by the appearance of its name, but you can tell by the
command's meaning: if the command stands for a glyph, it is in
class 2 and does not require an argument; if it makes sense to use the
command together with other text as part of a paragraph, the command
is in class 3 and must be followed by an argument in braces;
otherwise, it is in class 4 and uses the rest of the line as its
argument.
</para>
<para>The purpose of having a different syntax for commands of classes 3 and
4 is to make Texinfo files easier to read, and also to help the GNU
Emacs paragraph and filling commands work properly.  There is only one
exception to this rule: the command <literal>@refill</literal>, which is always
used at the end of a paragraph immediately following the final period
or other punctuation character.  <literal>@refill</literal> takes no argument and
does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require braces.  <literal>@refill</literal> never confuses the
Emacs paragraph commands because it cannot appear at the beginning of
a line.

(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</para>
<para>The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
</para>
<para>The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
</para>
<para>A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.
</para>
<para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ascii without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<abbrev>SGML</abbrev> or <abbrev>XML</abbrev> using a publicly available
<abbrev>DTD</abbrev>, and standard-conforming simple <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<abbrev>PDF</abbrev>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <abbrev>SGML</abbrev> or <abbrev>XML</abbrev> for which
the <abbrev>DTD</abbrev> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
</para>
<para>The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

<para>VERBATIM COPYING
</para>
<para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</para>
<para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>COPYING IN QUANTITY
</para>
<para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</para>
<para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</para>
<para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
</para>
<para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

<para>MODIFICATIONS
</para>
<para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</para>

<listitem>
<para>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities

stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

<para>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise

<para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</para>
<para>You may add a section entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</para>
<para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

<para>COMBINING DOCUMENTS
</para>
<para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
</para>
<para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</para>
<para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections entitled ``Acknowledgments'',
and any sections entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
entitled ``Endorsements.''

the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

<para>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
</para>
<para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an ``aggregate'', and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
</para>
<para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

<para>TRANSLATION
</para>
<para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
