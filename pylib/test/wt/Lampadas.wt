=Introduction|intro=

This document defines the architecture for the Lampadas Document Management System.
It is intended for developers working on the Lampadas System.


=Module List|module-list=

The following modules comprise the system:

*Globals

The Globals module contains utility and convenience routines.

*BaseClasses

The BaseClasses module contains classes that are never instantiated, but only used
as base classes upon which Lampadas objects are built.

*Config

This module parses the configuration file and provides those settings to the rest
of the system. Can be used by any other module.

*Log

Writes to the system log file. Can be used by any other module.

*Database

Accesses the back-end RDBMS system, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. This module is to be
used only by DataLayer and WebLayer.

*DataLayer

This module provides an object hierarchy to access base Lampadas data stored in the
database. This is the core module upon which almost all additional functionality is built.

*Lintadas

The Lintadas module is named after the Lintian system, which is used by Debian to
automatically check packages for validity. Both names refer to the program Lint, which
checks HTML for validity.

Lintadas performs a series of checks on the source files which make up each document.
It checks XML files to be sure they are valid XML, for example, and it checks to see
if the document contains stale WWW links. Those error reports are then stored into
the database and can be managed by system administrators and individual authors and
editors.

It also performs checks on the data in the DataLayer module, and therefore the data in
the back-end RDBMS. For example, it identifies when referenced files do not exist in
the filestore.

*AutoMirror

Lampadas automatically, selectively, mirrors articles in the Wikipedia and other
external repositories. This is not the same as just mirroring a single article.
The automirror system knows how to select the correct individual pages and parse them
into one of the source formats the system knows how to convert.

This is the module where any special-case processing should be implemented, for example
parsing a Wiki binary file to extract the WikiText itself.

It is anticipated that other types of source repositories will be supported in the
future, but currently support is available only for Wiki articles.

*Mirror

The Mirror module knows how to download documents which reside in external repositories,
like the GNU manuals, and store them in the local filesystem. It uses data in the
database to know which documents to mirror, and updates the database so information
about these mirrored files is available to the Converter module.

Mirror only copies and stores documents. If more sophisticated types of processing
are required, such as a Wiki article which must be parsed out of a binary data file,
then the AutoMirror module handles it.

Mirror is intended to download files via the HTTP or FTP protocols.

*Converter

The Converter module knows how to take documents in various formats and convert them
into the Lampadas standard output format, DocBook XML.

*WebLayer

This module provides an object hierarchy to access web pages, templates, blocks and strings.

*URLParse

This module splits a URL into its component parts. It has a special purpose addition,
which is that it recognizes a URL that contains a language specifier, and returns it as
Language, and thereby stripping it from the path.

Note: Lampadas lets you specify a language by adding /EN/, for example, to the
beginning of the URL.

*HTML

The HTML module generates HTML primitives, such as comboboxes, that are used to
make up the web pages. HTML generation methods require the caller to specify the
desired language as a two-character ISO code.

It also generates complete web pages for serving over HTTP to web browsers.
The content of the pages themselves is held in the database, to support online editing of
page content by system administrators, and also to support internationalization.

There is a templating system for the web pages and their text strings, which is
explained in the I18n section.

*WebServer

The WebServer module provides a web server for testing the system. It may be extended
and continued as one way of running a Lampadas server. A mod_perl website is also
planned, for running under the Apache web server.

                       Lintadas---DataLayer-----Database
</programlisting>

The Globals, BaseClasses, Log and Config modules can be freely referenced and used by any other module,
so to keep things simple they have been omitted from this diagram.
The other modules, however, have distinct relationships that must be understood and
followed.

The highly modular structure of the system was carefully designed to isolate
functionality. This makes the system much more easily extensible and much more
flexible.

This diagram shows the relationships between the core modules that make up Lampadas.
As the diagram indicates, the DataLayer is the key module. It provides access to 
the underlying database through an object hierarchy. Additional modules are built
on top of the DataLayer which implement specific functionality. Each of these can
be consider an "extension" of the system, and any number of them could be constructed.

The WebLayer module is another key module. Because it instantiates data for use by
a website and not core Lampadas data per se, it has been separated from the DataLayer.


=Internationalization|i18n=

Internationalization, or i18n for short, means support for multiple languages.
Localization, or l10n for short, is the process of adding the translations for a particular
language.

Lampadas fully supports i18n by storing strings in the database in Unicode. The DataLayer
module does not perform any localization, but returns in its data sets all possible
translations and strings. Objects which have multiple translated strings will have a
child object called I18n, which is a dictionary object. That dictionary contains an object
for each translation that is available. Each of those objects has a property for each
string the parent object needs. For example, for Class object has the following structure:

<literallayout>
Class['HOWTO'].I18n['EN'].Name = 'HOWTO'
Class['HOWTO'].I18n['EN'].Description = 'HOWTO do something in Linux'
</literallayout>

I18n for the website is handled through localizing text "blocks", web "pages", and text "strings".
These are accessed through the WebLayer module. Like DataLayer, it does not do the actual language
selection. That is performed by the HTML module which is built upon it.

The server reads the client browser's language settings, and attempts to serve pages
in the requested language, if possible. If that is not possible, the pages will revert
to English, as English is the <emphasis>lingua franca</emphasis> of the WWW.

However, the browser can also request a specific translation by appending the two character
ISO language code in front of the URL. So, to get the page
<literal>http://www.lampadas.org/home</literal> in the German language, he would use the URL
<literal>http://www.lampadas.org/DE/home</literal>.

=How Web Pages Are Generated|page-generation=

The page generation engine is based on Disk Files, Templates, Pages, Boxes, Tables,
Blocks and Strings.

Lampadas can send a static file to the client, or it can build a page dynamically.

For dynamic pages, 
a template defines the layout of the page, which is then built by assembling the specified
boxes, tables, blocks and strings to make the page content. The entire process is a fairly
complex one, so we'll walk through it step by step, with plenty of examples along the way.

==Static and Dynamic Pages|static-and-dynamic==

When a page is requested, the system first looks to see whether there is a file on disk
that matches the requested page. It looks in the directory specified in the configuration
variable, 'filedir'. This variable is available as the Config.FileDir property.
If a file is found, whether it is an image, a css stylesheet, or a
static web page, the file is sent to the client with the correct headers based on the
file type and file length.

If there is no static file to send, the system knows it must build the page dynamically,
so it looks for a page of the right name. All of the information used to build the page
starts with the page record.

==Strings, Blocks, and Pages|strings==

The string and string_i18n tables hold localized strings that are displayed on the web
page and elsewhere. Each string is named with a short text mnemonic. Blocks and pages
work basically the same way. Each has a mnemonic "name" by which it is referenced, as
well as a language code and the actual localized text itself.

These bits of localized text are only some of the primitives from which a dynamic page
is built. They are the parts that are easily editable by the Lampadas administrator
because they are held in the database, and can be edited through the Lampadas
administrator interface.

The other primitives are generated not from a database table, but inside the Lampadas
code itself. But we will deal with them a bit later. For now, let's just look at the 
text items and how they fit together.

As stated above, each page is stored in the page table, and its content can be localized.
But each page also specifies a template to be used. The page and template work together,
but they are stored separately so that the template, which specifies page layout, can
be reused easily, giving a consistent structure to the entire site.

With that in mind, let's look at how these elements are
assembled to create a page: the templating system.

==Templating and Tokens|templating==

When a page is requested, the system first determines what template that page is assigned
to, and loads it. Each page has one and only one template. The page contents really are only
the "body" part of the page, with no header, footer, or navigation controls. The template
fills in the surrounding parts of the result page.

You might think of it as the page being "embedded" into the template.
That concept will help you along as we dig deeper into the system, because "embedding"
of one bit of text inside another is the nature of how a page is built.
This will make more sense as you learn the way the templating system works.

Because each page can be assigned its own template,
each page can have its own customized navigation and header/footer if desired.
Normally, this is not necessary. However, in some cases you might want to have a page with
no navigation panel on the left, because the document is very wide and you need all of the
real estate. While Lampadas makes this easy through its templating system, it is
recommended that you maintain consistency in page layout by adding modified templates
only where necessary.

The default Lampadas installation comes with two templates: "default", and "index".
The "index" template is used for the home page, where we have extra navigation panels
that are not used throughout.

But to understand a template, we need to look at one.
So let's look at an actual Lampadas template:

<programlisting>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;|title|&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;base href="|base|"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/|stylesheet|.css" type="text/css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table class="layout" style="width:100%"&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;
      |header|
      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td width="200" valign="top"&gt;|boxmainmenu|&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td valign="top"&gt;
        |body|
        &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;
      |footer|
      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>

Here, you see that a template is the basic outline of a web page.
However, there are big pieces of it that are missing, and instead the template has
funny strings that are delimited by the pipe character, "|".
These strings are called tokens. Each token is the name of some other object,
whose contents are to be inserted in place of the token.

You can see in this template that there is a token called "body", or "|body|".
Every template must have a "body" token. It tells Lampadas where to insert the
contents of the page. So, as noted above, the page really is "embedded" inside
the template.

There are several kinds of tokens:

*Meta-data tokens
*Block tokens
*String tokens
*Code tokens

The "boxmainmenu" token is a "code" token. It is replaced by the output of a
built-in Lampadas routine. Most of these routines produce either a "Box",
which is a small table, such as a menu, or a "Table", which can be an edit
form, or a list of documents, and so on. The example give here, "boxmainmenu",
produces the Main Menu navigation box.

A list of code tokens appears at the end of this section.

Meta-data tokens represent some piece of meta-data about the page being built,
or perhaps some configuration value. In the example, the tokens "title", "base"
and "stylesheet" are meta-data tokens.
The "title" token is replaced by the title of the page,
appropriately localized. The "base" token is replaced by the website's base
URL. The "stylesheet" token is replaced by the user's preferred css stylesheet.

The meta-data tokens, like the code tokens, are written right into the Lampadas code.

A list of meta-data tokens is at the end of this section.

Unlike code and meta-data tokens, however, block and string tokens
are the names of text blocks and text strings, which can be freely edited
in the Lampadas database. This ability to define your own pages, blocks,
and strings lets you build your Lampadas website the way you want it.
The navigation controls, Boxes and Tables are written in code, because they are
the base of the system, but upon that base you can build whatever you want.

To understand how the whole thing works, though, let's take an example and work
through how it would be processed by Lampadas.
In the example template above, the "header" and "footer" tokens are both block tokens.
Lampadas will search for a block named "header", and then replace the "header"
token with the contents of that block. Now let's look at the contents of the
"header" token:

<programlisting>
&lt;table class="header" style="width:100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;|project| Lampadas System&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class="title"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;h1&gt;|title|&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</programlisting>

Again, This block just contains more HTML, and also some more tokens.
In the header, we have the tokens: "project" and "title", again.
The "title" token here is the same token we saw in the template,
so in this example the page title, properly localized,
appears both in the title bar of
your browser and in a table at the top of the page.

The "project" token is a string token. The engine would simply replace
it with the value specified in the string table, properly localized.

The "project" string token is a default token, that is, it comes
preinstalled in a new Lampadas installation, although during system configuration,
you should set it to hold the name of your project. However, the Lampadas
administrator can add any tokens she needs, and refer to them in her
templates, pages, blocks, and even other strings.

Here is what the page would look like after the tokens have been replaced
with their textual values, including the "header" token:

<programlisting>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;base href="/&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/default.css" type="text/css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table class="layout" style="width:100%"&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;
&lt;table class="header" style="width:100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Linux Documentation Project Lampadas System&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class="title"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;h1&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td width="200" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;table class="box"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Main Menu&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;a href="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...
&lt;a href="help"&gt;Help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td valign="top"&gt;
This is Lampadas, the LDP document management system.
...
        &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;|footer|&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>

The new, embedded portions are left aligned where possible, to make it easier
for you to see them. But we still have not embedded the "footer" token, so let's
take a look at it now:

<programlisting>
&lt;table class="footer" style="width:100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="copyright"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt; \|
&lt;a href="privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt; \|
&lt;a href="lampadas"&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="/EN/|page|"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; \|
&lt;a href="/FR/|page|"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</programlisting>

You might have been wondering how one would enter a pipe character inside
a page, since the pipe character is used as a delimiter. In this footer,
we can see the answer. Pipe characters that are not delimiters must be
"escaped" by using a backslash character. So, "\|" is a real pipe character,
and will not be considered a delimiter.

Moving on to the rest of the "footer",  we see that we have more HTML
and more tokens.
In this footer, we have two links that
take you to translations in French and English. See the
[[i18n|Internationalization]] section for an explanation of the
<literal>/EN/</literal> and <literal>/FR/</literal> prefixes.

And we see a new meta-data token, the "page" token. It is replaced by
the name of the current page.

After embedding the footer, and then embedding the values for its tokens,
the page is complete. Here is how the example page would look when all tokens
have been processed:

<programlisting>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;base href="/&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/default.css" type="text/css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table class="layout" style="width:100%"&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;
&lt;table class="header" style="width:100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Linux Documentation Project Lampadas System&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class="title"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;h1&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td width="200" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;table class="box"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Main Menu&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;a href="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...
&lt;a href="help"&gt;Help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td valign="top"&gt;
This is Lampadas, the LDP document management system.
...
        &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;
&lt;table class="footer" style="width:100%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="copyright"&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;a href="privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;a href="lampadas"&gt;About Lampadas&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="/EN/about"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;a href="/FR/about"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>

Now that we've been through the entire set of elements from which a page is
built, and walked through the process step by step, 
you should understand conceptually the way a page is pieced together.
Logically speaking, the template is the top of the embedding system.
The page is embedded into the template, and blocks and strings are
embedded into the page. But blocks and strings can be nested inside
each other, as well. So, theoretically, you could have a block that
contains a string token, that contains a block token, that contains
another block token, etc., as deeply as you need to go. For obvious
reasons, however, tokens cannot be nested circularly, or an error
will result.

There is one additional wrinkle that has not yet been addressed.
Code token replacement text often contains block or string tokens.
For example, the contents of the Main Menu are variable based on the
current user's permissions, so it has to be generated by code, but the
text strings it contains still have to be localized. To perform the localization,
the Main Menu token ("boxmainmenu") embeds a series of strings.
Then, the text that is actually presented to each user can be localized
to their preferred language.

==Lists of Tokens|token-list==

===Code and Meta-data Tokens|codetokens===

The following Code and meta-data tokens are available in the initial
Lampadas install:

*title: 
The page title.

*body: 
The body of the page, always included in a template, but never elsewhere.

*hostname: 
The server's hostname, as defined in the configuration file.

*rootdir:
The root directory of Lampadas on your web server, from the configuration file.

*port:
The port on which Lampadas is being served, from the configuration file.

*base:
The base URL of the Lampadas section of your website. This is built from the
hostname, the port, and the rootdir, all of which come from the configuration file.

*page:
The name of the page. This is its mnemonic name, not its title.

*stylesheet:
The user's preferred stylesheet, or the default.

*boxmainmenu:
The Main Menu navigation box.

*tabdocstable:
The list of documents in a browsable, sortable table.

*tabeditdoc:
The form in which one edits document meta-data.

===Block and String Tokens|blocktokens==

The following block and string tokens are available in the initial Lampadas install.
You can, of course, add to or modify them. In fact, some of them should be modified
during installation.

*header: 
The default page header.

*footer: 
The default page footer.

*project: 
The name of your project, e.g., "The Linux Documentation Project".

*projectshort: 
The short name of your project, e.g., "The LDP".

*mmtitle: 
The title of the Main Menu.

*home: 
The word "home", localized. Used in the Main Menu.

*doctable: 
The words "Doc Table", localized. Used in the Main Menu.

*docdetails: 
The words "Document Details", localized. Used in the document meta-data edit form.


=Coding Conventions|codingstyle=

The code generally follows Python coding style.

*Constants are in all uppercase.

*Class names are in TitleCase.

*Attributes, properties and methods are in lower_case, with underscore separators.

*Private variables are in lowercase.

*Indentation is done using four spaces, not tabs.

*Each class, method and property should have a docstring that describes its purpose.
The docstrings are used to generate library documentation, so this is very important.
Constructors, destructors, and other self-identifying routines do not necessarily need
a docstring, unless their operation is somehow different from what one would expect.
/*

Here is an example. You can, of course, find many more right in the code.

<programlisting>
WILL_NOT_CHANGE = "(c) Copyright 3l33t h4x0r"

class ClassName:
    """This class does something"""
    
    color = None

    def __init__(self) :
        self.other_color = None

    def my_method(self) :
        """do something"""
</programlisting>
