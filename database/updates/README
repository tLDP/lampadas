*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** 

                  ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE
                       ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE IT!

        TAKE THIS WARNING SERIOUSLY, OR PAY THE CONSEQUENCES!!!

*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** 

These are scripts for updating the database tables between releases.
They are named according to the version to which they convert the database.
So, update-0.2 updates the database from version 0.1 to version 0.2.
The scripts use config.version to identify the current database version, and
abort if you're trying to do something illegal.

No attempt is made to update from, say, 0.1 to 0.3. To update from 0.1 to 0.3
you have to run update-0.2, then update-0.3.

After you run the update script, back up your data again. You must have saved
your first backup in a safe location, because it will be overwritten. Then,
recreate your database using the new createdb.sh, and reload your data. This
is required because the update script is not guaranteed to establish all
referential integrity rules, only table structures.
