Guylhem wants to be able to flag a document, "maintainers needed", even if it
is maintained but the maintainer needs or wants help. (David)

Display the number of times the document has been read. Think of and add other
metrics of this nature. This should be an optional feature, since it will add
overhead and some admins might not want that overhead. (David)

We need a cron job that runs nightly and stores statistics into the stats and
stats_cdf tables. This should be a Python module (Stats.py), which deletes
and then replaces any existing records for the current day. The cron job would
just be a call to that library. So put the Python module in pylib, but put the
wrapper script under /lampadas/cron (a new directory). See the old Perl code,
and just port it. Feel free to recommend additional metrics that would be
valuable to the management of the site. Also add user count, which didn't
apply to the LDPDB but does apply to Lampadas. And docs served, pages served.

Write a Makefile to install Lampadas onto a fresh system. Also let `make test`
run the unit tests, and `make clean` remove any installation. `make tar` and
other build targets would be nice, too.
	-- wrote Makefiles, but no test target yet

Add date_entered timestamps to additional records where it is appropriate.
Maybe even to all of them. It's nice meta-data to have. And add creator_id
also, to record the user who created the record. Then it will have to
be passed in through all the Add methods.

Remember the number of times a user has logged on, and when they last logged
on, and maybe even their IP address in case of DoS or other attacks by a user.

Improve the security system so that instead of single boolean fields to get
permissions (e.g., the admin and sysadmin fields), each user can be assigned
a role which comes with a set of permissions. This will allow more fine-
grained control over permissions, so admins can customize them to fit their
particular organizational needs.

Flatten the topic/subtopic structures into a single table with topic_id as
the record identifier, plus topic_num and subtopic_num for display only.
This will let people reorder and renumber topics without having to alter any
referring records in document_topic.

Make sure that email addresses are spam-protected everywhere they display on
the website!

Add a table of programs, maybe from the Debian repository and/or Red Hat
and/or the rpmfind.net database. Then let people record what applications
a document covers. So, a document could be listed as a "User's Guide", and
also tagged with the application "mutt". Then the system knows by meta-data
that the document is a user's guide to mutt.

Allow users to record the distribution they are using, and let them browse
through only the documentation that applies to that distribution, as a kind
of a filter. Applying filters could be a very powerful way to search the
database, especially once it gets up into the thousands of documents.

Allow users to tag documents as their "Favorites", so they can come back
and find them again quickly and easily.

Add the capability to merge in the entire contents of the server's
ScrollKeeper database, automatically. That would make it a piece of cake
to publish the Gnome and KDE documentation, which is already available
there, with a minimum of maintenance.

Allow users to "request to be notified" when a document is updated.
This will be particularly useful for translators, but others could
find it useful as well.

IBM wants to write a CQS module for Lampadas, but we need to define a search
API implemented in a URL scheme for them to code against. This is pretty
high priority because it will give us a huge amount of visibility and help
build the project.

Write manpage.
	-- done, for lampadasdb and lampadasweb
	
Need mod_perl front end.

Speed up initial loading; it's annoying and overhead for short running scripts.
Loading all tables in single SELECT statements would help a lot,
but would require top level objects to do the loading.

Need combobox for selecting seriesid for a document.

Need to devise set of error messages and add them to Lintadas.

Add support for the W3C core CSS styles, if possible.
