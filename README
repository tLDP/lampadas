These are the scripts for generating, saving, restoring, and managing
the LDP Database which is available online at http://db.linuxdoc.org.

The database stores meta-data on LDP documents.

It also provides for Wiki-like editing of documents, with full versioning
and accountability for changes.

Security
--------

Anyone may browse and search the database.

Only registered users can make changes to the database at this time.

Each user is recorded in the `username' table. If the 'admin' field is True,
the user may alter anything in the database. If the 'maintainer_id' field
is set to a value, the user may modify any documents which are being actively
maintained by that maintainer.

Admins may add new maintainers and documents.

Only admins and authors may edit documents, and authors may only edit their
own documents.
