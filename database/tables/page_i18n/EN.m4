    As a member of this Lampadas community, you can collaborate with
    hundreds or even thousands of others to produce documentation,
    which can then be shared with others all around the world over the
    Web.
    
    <p>We\'ve designed the Lampadas system to make contributing simple and easy.
    Here are some ways you can help, roughly in order of difficulty or
    commitment required:

    <ul>
    <li>Rate Documents

    <p>Each document has a "rating", on a scale of 1 to 10, which tells you
    what other readers think of it.
    We use this rating to improve our documents, for focusing our attention
    on the documents you\'ve identified as neednig improvement.
    </li>

    <li>Report a Bug

    <p>If you find an error in any document, file a bug report.
    </li>
    
    <li>Translate a Document

    <p>Translators are always in short supply, and we value them very much.
    Our goal is to provide all of our documentation in as many languages as possible,
    allowing people all over the world to take advantage of it.
    </li>

    <li>Write a Document

    <p>If you are a good writer with solid technical knowledge,
    write a new document and contribute it to the collection.
    Lampadas has several tools that will help you.
    </li>
    
    <li>Help Lampadas

    <p>If you have programming or translating skills, you can help to develop
    the platform upon which this site is based.

    <p>The Lampadas System itself can be localized to display in several languages.
    Translators are needed to translate it into additional languages.
    It is currently available in:

    <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>German</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>This website is based on version |version| of the Lampadas Documentation Management System,
    a Free Software (GPL) platform developed by
    <a href="http://www.tldp.org">The Linux Documentation Project</a>.
    
    <p>Lampadas is a powerful, flexible platform designed to support large documentation
    projects such as the LDP.
    It provides an interactive environment for writing, managing,
    publishing and reading documentation.

    <p>Lampadas creates a collaborative community which
    includes authors, editors, technical experts, and readers all working
    together to produce documentation, and to share information with each other.

    <h1>Why Lampadas?</h1>

    <p>Fans of Frank Herbert\'s Dune series will recognize Lampadas as the name
    of the Bene Gesserit teaching planet, which plays a role in the final book,
    Chapterhouse: Dune.
    Before the planet can be destroyed by hordes of Honored Matres,
    Reverend Mother Lucia orders the planet to share Other Memory,
    two by two then four by four, until all the students hold within
    them the composite knowledge and memories of the entire planet.
    After the planet is annihilated by the Honored Matres, the precious
    knowledge is carried back to the Bene Gesserit Chapterhouse by the
    lone holder of the precious cargo, Rebecca.

    <p>Herbert apparently took the name from the city of Lampadas,
    which was an ancient seat of learning and scholarship.
    Also, the word lampadas is the accusative form of the word "Torch" in ancient Greek.

    <p>In all of these senses, Lampadas seems an appropriate name for
    this project, which is created to facilitate sharing information
    from many people and many sources, and disseminating it widely to others.
