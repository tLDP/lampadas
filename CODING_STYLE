Usual Python coding style :

1. class names are capitalized as in

class ClassName :
    pass

2. attributes/properties names are lowercase as in 

class ClassName :

    color = None

    def __init__(self) :
        self.other_color = None

3. constants are in uppercase as in 

WILL_NOT_CHANGE = "(c) Copyright 3l33t h4x0r"

4. method names are in lowercase as in 

class ClassName :

    def my_method(self) :
        """do something"""

5. i surely forgot something, would you help filling out the blanks ?
