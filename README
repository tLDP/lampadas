This is Lampadas, an online document production and publication system.
Lampadas is Free Software; see COPYING for details.

Lampadas is a young project, although it is based on the LDP Database,
which has been in actual use for over a year. It is not yet recommended
for production use.

See INSTALL for requirements, and the Lampadas Developer's Guide for
information about the system. The Guide and other documentation is in
the /doc directory.
