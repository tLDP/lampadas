Installation of lampadas is a bloody mess.
Report all problems, suggestions and flames to

Tested with Red Hat 7.3, Debian 3.0r0 and SuSE 7.3. 

=============
Documentation
=============

Directory 'doc' holds some related plain text files.
'doc/INSTALL.ancient' are the original notes from David Merill.
'doc/INSTALL.mandrake' is the diary of a successful installation
on Mandrake 8.2. (FIXME: by whom?)

=============
Outline
=============

The process can be summarized like this:

0. Copy/extract lampadas files

   Reading this file means you somehow accomplished this step. 
   Note that lampadas does not require compilation and copying of
   resulting files to some destination directory. Move the whole
   directory to the final location, e.g. /opt/lampadas.

1. Install postgresql database

   All major distributions provide pre-fabricated packages of
   postgresql. You still need to create user accounts and configure
   authentication, though.

2. Install Apache with mod_python and python 2.x

FIXME

x. Install a zillion requisites.
   ./configure should help in identifying some of them.

x. Use ./configure to patch some values of your configuration.
   Manually edit bin/setenv.sh and conf/lampadas.conf

=============
Postgresql
=============

Usually there is only one priviledged account (called 'postgres')
with access to the postmaster. You will need two other local accounts.
One for database management, one for the webserver.

To grant another local account access, do this as root (since postgres
has no set password).

   su - postgres -c 'createuser -A -d alba'

'alba' is my account name on my machines, chose something approriate.
You won't need root access again for the database.
Log in with the new account ('alba' in above example) and create a
database instance called 'lampadas':

   createdb -E UNICODE lampadas

Test the result:

   psql lampadas

=============
Apache
=============

Please run the webserver under a separate account like 'apache',
not under a shared account like 'nobody'.
