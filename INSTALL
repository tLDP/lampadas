Installation from the tarball or .tar.gz, or from CVS, uses standard
Makefiles. run `make` to build the few things that need to be built,
primarily the documentation. Then run `make install` as root to install
files.

Files are installed into the following locations by default. To change
them, edit the Makefiles.

binaries:		/usr/local/bin
man pages:		/usr/share/man/man5
				/usr/share/man/man8
Lampadas.pth:	/usr/local/lib/site-python
python modules:	/usr/local/lib/site-python/Lampadas
html, png, css:	/usr/local/share/lampadas/www
SQL scripts:	/usr/local/share/lampadas/sql
