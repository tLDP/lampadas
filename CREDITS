Thanks to:

	Rick Welykochy <rick@praxis.com.au>, bugfixes for the original LDPDB.

	The KDE Project (http://www.kde.org), for some icons.

	The Gnome Project (http://www.gnome.org), and particularly the Gnome
	Documentation Project (http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/) for
	hosting our Bugzilla database.
	
	For help with the ScrollServer project, which was a precursor of
	this one, thanks go to Malcolm Tredinnick <malcolm@commsecure.com.au>
	for help while I was learning Python, and to Nik Clayton for help
	with XSLT stylesheets.

Special Thanks:

	Martin Wheeler, an LDP author, originally suggested a Wiki for the
	LDP. While the LDP has not implemented a Wiki, Martin's idea was
	the impetus for my creating a Wiki-style editing interface in the
	LDPDB. That interface was never very polished or complete, an only
	I ever used it. Building it was a royal pain.

	I decided the LDPDB architecture was insufficient to the task, but
	I recognized the potential a user-contributed documentation database
	could have for Linux and all Free Software.

	That was when I launched Lampadas, which didn't even have a name at
	that time. So, I extend a very special Thank You to Martin for
	inspiring all of this.
