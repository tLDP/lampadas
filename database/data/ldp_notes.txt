87	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Updated 1999-12-27 per document body.	david

184	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Ferg is publishing html, we're waiting for db volunteer. Author is adding new licensing.	david       
191	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Waiting on relicense Author is cool. Asked about docbook also, author is cool once again. :-) He wants cvs, directed him to LAG.	david

Searched google, found swalton@columbus.rr.com, tried it, got an answer. New email is swalton@columbus.rr.com. He says it covers only the 2.0 kernel. He has no time but will try. I asked if we could get it under GFDL and use the contents if he has no time. He said yes. I am now confirming whether he wants to continue maintainership at all, or just pass it on to someone else. Waiting on that reply.	david       
218	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Updated XML to SGML, send email letting him know. Email bounced, trying again. bounced again, trying jkatz@cs.columbia.edu (found on google). wrong guy. Wrote to jon@jonworld.com per Ferg.	david       
244	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Wrote for update. Asked for relicense, docbook, etc. He says he never submitted it and it is part of the kernel documentation. He's thinking about whether to rewrite or just convert to DocBook.	david       
254	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Pulled email from google and pinged it. It's him, he gave me copyright and relicensed GFDL.	david       
261	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	WAY outdated	david       
281	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Asked him to add pubdate and revhistory in future versions. He said he would.	david       
293	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Duplicate title! This one seems to be 2.0.	david

331	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Asked author if he will release under GFDL so his doc can be updated for newer kernels. He said yes, and may even help with that and with docbook conversion. Wrote back and asked him to update license and title.	david       
332	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Asked author if he will release under GFDL so his doc can be updated for newer kernels. He wrote back but didn't answer the question, just said it was outdated. Wrote back to ask for GFDL again.	david       
336	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Asked author to rename ""Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2 HOWTO"" to be consistent, and asked for db, gfdl, update.	david

367	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Duplicate title! This one seems to be 2.2 and 2.4.	david       
373	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Duplicate title!	david

334	2001-04-26 11:26:00-04	Ori Pomerantz <ori@simple-tech> says he assigned copyright and maintainership to Peter Jay Salzman <p@dirac.org> because he has no time to maintain it. He believes the new maintainer is updating or has updated it for 2.4 and converted to docbook. I wrote the new maintain and asked about the status.	david       
334	2001-04-22 23:54:00-04	Asked author to convert to DocBook and retitle.	david       
98	2001-04-26 18:36:00-04	Got a response, and he seems very amenable to working with me. He was not sure what I exactly wanted for the date formats in pubdate and revhistory, so I showed him examples. The document is already in docbook.	david       
244	2001-04-26 23:55:00-04	Deleted by Ferg	david       
172	2001-04-23 10:29:00-04	Sent a quick mail asking if he is still maintaining it.	david       
334	2001-04-25 23:56:00-04	Received email from PJS. He says he has reworked the first 4 chapters to reflect the 2.4 kernel, with some support for 2.2 as well. He is waiting on review from his LUG and the original author, after which he will submit it.	david       
306	2001-04-25 23:56:00-04	Ferg renamed the source file and added it to cvs.	david       
309	2001-04-29 23:58:00-04	David wrote back and said he no longer maintains it, but the project is still active and the document not too outdated. DOS is not changing much these days, after all. :-)	david       
145	2001-04-29 23:58:00-04	Retitled from Linux Consultants HOWTO to Linux Consultants Guide.	david

346	2001-04-30 23:58:00-04	David Lawyer is going to update the manifesto to indicate that we will maintain documents if they met its requirements when submitted, even if the requirements change later. Since this document met the requirements in 1995, when first published, it will remain in the collection.	david       
112	2001-04-30 23:58:00-04	Wrote to the publisher and author again since they have not responded in over a week.	david       
229	2001-05-01 23:57:00-04	Sent mail to all who took over unmaintained docs, asking wtf.	david       
39	2001-05-01 23:57:00-04	Sent mail to all who took over unmaintained docs, asking wtf.	david       
348	2001-05-01 09:39:00-04	Wrote Shiva to ask for update since he volunteered to take over maintainership. He wrote back and said he will have an update very soon.	david       
417	2001-05-01 11:18:00-04	Asked on #linpeople, then #openprojects, then asked lilo at support@openprojects.net what to do with it.	david       
179	2001-05-01 11:38:00-04	Got response, he is working on it but it is taking some time. He is doing DocBook as well as updating the document.	david       
179	2001-05-01 09:56:00-04	Sent mail to all who took over unmaintained docs, asking wtf.	david       
39	2001-05-02 07:54:00-04	Sreenu said he is maintaining it, but it does not need any work. I told him it needed to be edited and converted to DocBook or it was in danger of removal. If he cannot find time to edit it, let us find someone who will.	david       
178	2001-05-02 09:25:00-04	Wrote Anthony E. Greene for update on DocBook conversion	david       
228	2001-05-02 09:29:00-04	Wrote to Chuck Dale about DocBook markup	david       
89	2001-05-02 09:31:00-04	Wrote Sreenu Sasubilli about DocBook markup.	david       
162	2001-05-02 09:32:00-04	Wrote to Phillipe Martin <feloy@free.fr> about DocBook markup.	david       
172	2001-01-01 12:00:00-05	Pinged to him again since he has not answered but the mail has not bounced either.	david       
112	2001-05-02 14:28:00-04	Author wrote to see if publisher had responded, and I said no. Still waiting.	david       
162	2001-05-02 14:32:00-04	Received updated DocBook From Mr. Martin, forwarded to submit and original author (Tobby Bannerjee tobbyb@usa.net).	david       
172	2001-05-02 17:21:00-04	Got a return message. He thinks he has an update but is not sure which machine it is on. He thinks the document should be retired because the kernel has moved on. I asked him to do one final update and release it under GFDL so we can maintain it, and archive it for users of earlier kernels.	david       
228	2001-05-03 08:18:00-04	Wrote to Jens, the author, to get his updates.	david       
228	2001-05-03 08:17:00-04	Received a reply. He said he finished the DocBook a year ago, and the last he knew was that Jens, the author, was going to do some finishing touches and submit it. This version is at http://clusion.net/tmp/man/	david       
89	2001-05-03 08:22:00-04	Received reply, and he is too busy to do it now. Forwarded to Ferg to update the list of docs needing markup.	david       
331	2001-05-03 19:33:00-04	Ferg may have an author willing to take over maintainership. I wrote the original author to follow up on the relicensing issue.	david       
331	2001-05-04 10:26:00-04	Author still willing to help with document but only as a helper. I again requested the GFDL so we have the legal right to do so.	david       
331	2001-05-04 11:38:00-04	David Rusling sent nice, clear statement of relicensing.	david       
229	2001-05-07 09:41:36-04	Received an email from Phil Kerr, who is working on a full MIDI HOWTO to replace this one. He had a system crash, but will be sending it to us soon. Marked tickle date in two weeks.	david       
346	2001-05-09 15:05:39-04	I was wrong about the license. I just overlooked it.	david       
15	2001-05-12 11:49:52-04	Heard back from him. He said Debian had also asked him to relicense or they would not carry it, and he is going to do so. He has already converted to DocBook but keeps finding more changes he wants to make.\
\
I wrote back and encouraged him to release it as is and continue to update incrementally.\
\
He is off to India for 3 weeks but says he will post when he returns.	david       
172	2001-05-12 16:19:41-04	He said he has just been married and so is very busy. He expects to sort it out within three weeks. He also said he wants to know what the GFDL is, so I sent him the url.	david       
324	2001-05-15 10:34:48-04	ESR requested the document be removed because he is no longer maintaining it.	david       
324	2001-05-15 10:35:40-04	Martin Wheeler is supposed to be working on a Guide to replace it. Wrote to him asking for the status.	david       
421	2001-05-15 11:04:45-04	Wrote to ask about the status. Ferg said it was in progress but that is all I know.	david       
422	2001-05-15 13:49:35-04	Asked Ferg why it isn't stored in linuxdoc but on ibiblio, and he said he thought there is a reason but cannot remember it.	david       
422	2001-05-15 13:49:03-04	Wrote to the author and asked why it is stored on ibiblio and not linuxdoc. Also asked for an update if one is available.	david       
422	2001-05-15 14:31:13-04	Author replied and said there is no update, and the reason it is stored offsite is because it is in a nonstandard dtd. This was because LinuxDoc didn't support images. He also said it is very out of date and he would just as soon we deleted it.	david       
421	2001-05-15 16:06:42-04	Martin wrote back with the URL to the ddraft copy. I took a look and it looks fine, although not complete. Martin said give him until the end of the month, so I set a tickle for 2001-05-31.	david       
422	2001-05-15 20:27:18-04	He's planning to do some articles on high availability before the end of the year, and so this will be updated at the same time as a byproduct. I asked if he would go ahead and convert to docbook so we can add it to the main collection, or find a volunteer to do it for him.	david       
421	2001-05-15 20:42:07-04	Martin wrote again and said we could publish it as is if we want to, so I asked him to send it to the submit list.	david       
12	2001-05-16 10:56:19-04	Received email from a user <emmanuel.blot@ireland.sun.com> who says this howto refers to ldp-discuss@linuxdoc.org, which is of course dead.	david       
120	2001-05-16 19:31:07-04	Long lines are not wrapping because they use <pre> tags. This needs to be fixed. I sent an email to the author requesting a correction.\
	david       
120	2001-05-17 17:37:48-04	Author replied and said he would correct it.	david       
39	2001-05-18 11:36:00-04	Since he asked for one week's time, I gave him two. Wrote back today to see if he had made any progress.	david       
89	2001-05-18 12:11:11-04	I asked to see if he had gotten time to update it, and he indicated that he wants to pass it on to someone else.	david       
89	2001-05-18 12:14:17-04	Asked Jeff Self <jocknerd@home.com> to convert it.	david       
423	2001-05-18 21:41:44-04	Met Daniel on the TT list. He posted a great intro to X and window manager, so I asked him to submit it. He is going to.	david       
89	2001-05-20 02:53:54-04	Jeff said he will try to put some time into it this weekend.	david       
228	2001-05-20 21:10:18-04	Received reply from Jens. Got updated copy in HTML. Wrote back asking him to work with Chuck and submit DocBook.	david       
422	2001-05-20 21:47:08-04	Wrote again and asked Harald to please convert to DocBook, or if not to let us know if we can find someone else to do it.	david       
229	2001-05-20 21:55:47-04	Pinged Phil Kerr again, phil@plus24.com\
	david       
393	2001-05-21 13:05:02-04	Recieved mail from Parag Mehta <pm@gnuos.org> who is going to either convert to docbook or maintain. Googled and found possible guy, dan@pancamo.com. Send an email to see.	david       
423	2001-05-21 13:09:51-04	Document has been received, tweaked by me and Ferg, and published.	david       
424	2001-05-22 09:47:47-04	Phil hopes to complete it and submit this weekend.	david       
229	2001-05-22 09:48:09-04	Received confirmation he hopes to submit it this weekend. Added new record for it.	david       
422	2001-05-22 10:05:28-04	Harald wants to retire the document and rewrite it this fall. I wrote to Ferg to see what he wants to do.	david       
422	2001-05-22 10:16:32-04	Ferg wants to remove it. He is removing it. I wrote the author and added tickle date on Sept 1 to nudge the author about it.	david       
424	2001-05-29 10:43:35-04	Phil wrote again, and is having hardware problems involving his mobo. So he asked for 3/4 weeks to get that fixed and do a reinstall and a complete test of the HOWTO.	david       
393	2001-05-30 00:59:02-04	Tried mailing dan_pancamo@aimfunds.com	david       
99	2001-05-30 01:04:42-04	Sergey Nikitin sergey@indexoffice.com volunteered to take this one over. Wrote to Keith to check on copyright.	david       
417	2001-05-30 01:27:30-04	Resent the message.	david       
229	2001-05-30 01:29:29-04	Received an update. He is making progress, but has had further hardware woes. ETA is 3-4 weeks.	david       
353	2001-05-30 10:14:35-04	Received an answer from Lars Wizernius. He is cool with moving to the GFDL. He says he and Joanna will do one minor update, changing to gfdl, and then pass it on to the new maintainer(s).	david       
393	2001-05-30 10:19:29-04	Heard back, it is him. Wrote asking him to relicense.	david       
393	2001-05-30 10:50:30-04	He is willing to relicense. Officially assigned Parag Mehta to the document, and asked him to do an immediate release in DocBook under GFDL, then do his rewrite.	david       
417	2001-05-30 18:26:01-04	Rob Levin <support@openprojects.net> wrote to say he was just busy and would get to it eventually.	david       
281	2001-05-31 11:00:45-04	Sadly, the license is restrictive and the new edition that just came out is proprietary. :-(	david       
39	2001-06-04 23:57:21-04	Sreenu asked to be removed from the list.	david       
89	2001-06-05 00:04:32-04	No word yet, so I wrote Jeff again. I had asked him to talk to Mr. Poet about what to do with the doc. I just asked him again.	david       
179	2001-06-05 00:11:28-04	Sent a ping to see how it's going.	david
