Lampadas Conversion Module

NOTE: This module is obsolete. When I realized every conversion
was a call to an external program, I began writing a Makefile for
each document during the mirroring process.

This module converts source documents into DocBook XML format.

Currently supported source formats are:

	Plain Text
	WikiText
	Texinfo
	DocBook SGML
	Linuxdoc

Working on:

Pie-in-the-sky:

	DebianDoc
	PyDoc
	*roff
